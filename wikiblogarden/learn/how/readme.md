# How to learn

Most people are really bad at learning. Don't let that be you!

<br>

<br>

The worst way to learn is by:

## 1. Reading

Equivalent to someone monologuing at you for hours, reading is utter pants when it comes to learning.

<br>

A marginally better way to learn is by: 

## 2. Talking

Talking about the thing you're trying to learn is slightly better because it's not passive. You're an active participant, but still it's very bad.

<br>

The only real way to learn is by: 

## 3. Doing

Practice is the only effective way to learn. By trying and failing again and again, you get better and better. It's painful and it can be embarrassing but it works. 

<br>

<br>

Practice, just [practice](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/genocide/platform/) is what you need. 

And what makes good practice? That's a question for another day
