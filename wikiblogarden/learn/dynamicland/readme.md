# Understanding dynamicland

I had a really great conversation with someone who worked at [dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/) about [dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/). And it really helped me to understand more about what [dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/) is and the philosophy behind it and so on. 

And I kept coming back to this conversation about [dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/) to reflect on what they said about [dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/)â€” to think it through and try to relate to [dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/)'s goals and philosophy. This is especially interesting to me currently because my current work is steering towards being about [learning](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/learn/pastagang/accident/arroost/) and I believe [dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/) has a lot of interesting stuff to say about that. 

Multiple times, I asked this person if I could share what they said publicly, so that: 

1. Other people can join in, and benefit like me. 
2. I can archive the useful information. 

But unfortunately they didn't respond to those requests.

Sadly, this whole conversation took place within twitter private messages, and this person has now [wisely](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/genocide/twitter/died/) deactivated their twitter account.

This means that all our messages are now [gone](https://mas.to/@TodePond/113525049650977841). I can't read them anymore. I have to rely on my memory instead and my memory is terrible.

I don't blame this person at all and I don't have any bad feelings towards them. Quite the opposite! I thank them deeply for spending the time to talk to me. It was very helpful and rewarding. 

I also don't blame them for deleting their twitter account. I commend their boldness and principle! 

I just think it's sad we lost that conversation.
