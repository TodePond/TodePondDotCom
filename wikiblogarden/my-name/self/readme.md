# Yourself

carve your own path\
go your own way\
you can't be anybody else\
you can't be anyone but—

pick your own fight\
reach your own goal\
you can't be anybody else\
you can't be anyone but—

do your own task\
tell your own tale\
dance your own dance\
sing your own song

be your own self\
be your whole own self\
you can't be anybody no\
you can't be anyone else

<br>

you can't be anybody other\
not anyone else\
you can't be anybody anyone\
apart from yourself

<br>
