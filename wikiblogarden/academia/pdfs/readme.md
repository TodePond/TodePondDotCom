onto my tabs bar\

PDFs are so bad\
PDFs are so bad\
PDFs are so so so so bad\
this doesn't mean that\
other things are good\
they're so bad too!\
they're so bad too\
they're so so so so\
so bad too

why is it so hard\
to say what is bad\
when it is\
bad for me\
if not for you

> but Lu\
> nothing else is more\
> long lasting and reliable\
> than PDFs

oh here we go

i refuse to believe\
that a PDF\
is the long lasting format\
of humankind\
when even text\
even text is easier\
to keep around\
and pass on\
and keep the same

text and pictures\
in a list\
that's all we need\
maybe more\
but the minimum is already better\
than PDFs

*oh PDFs*

let go of perfection\
of perfect lines\
and paragraphs\
that don't line up\
but now they do\
because you stretched them out\
using ancient software\
made by a neat freak

> but Lu

no\
I will no longer hear it\
go reply to someone else

if PDFs are not dead\
it's because I haven't killed them yet 

I'll say it again\
I'll say it again

PDFs are so bad\
PDFs are so bad\
PDFs are so so so so\
so so so so\
so so so so so\
SO\
so so so bad
