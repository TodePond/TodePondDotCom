I need at least two hands to count the number of people who have told me that they suffer from this one specific problem. Maybe I should introduce them so they can all suffer together.

These people are often well-respected "veterans" of a certain "scene" in the sense that people view them as a core part of that scene's in-group and they struggle with that in some way. While individual experiences differ, they all wish they could "go back" a little bit. They miss their time spent as a newcomer where they could get away with being more radical or more of an outsider or more free to do as they wished without people caring so much. It's not a bad thing. These people recognise the responsibility they have. They're an unintentional figurehead. And if you're reading this right now and wondering if I'm writing about you in particular then please know that I'm not: This is a very common and normal phenomenon.

I think these people find it hard to talk about because it sounds a bit big-headed / a bit like a first world problem. It can sound like "Oh no it's so hard being so important" if it's understood wrong. But I think it's the natural burden of recognised responsibility.

But I don't get it really. I mean... No I do get it. I do understand why you'd feel like that, but I think you should recognise that you're doing people even more of a disservice by holding back. If you really feel that responsibility to serve a scene well, then I think it's worth being as bold as you always were. It's more risky, for sure, but I don't think it's a risk to the scene: I think it's a risk to yourself. By accepting that role, I don't think you're protecting the scene: You're protecting yourself. 

So that's why you should keep causing trouble.
