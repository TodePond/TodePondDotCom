# Why be bad on purpose

Bad is just a word\
To describe a reaction\
That you may or may not\
Want to achieve

With code it's all about\
Execution\
So transmit the code\
That does the right thing 

To change someone\
Or send a message\
Or turn a page\
Or bring on peace

Every creative decision\
Is a declaration of values\
Among a wider context\
To place your work\
Within or without\
Existing traditions\

Let all of your\
Automata unfold\
Become free to express\
What you really are
