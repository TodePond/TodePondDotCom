# Better computing

There are some people out there trying to make us **use computers better**.

## Robust-first computing

Be [robust](https://andrewwalpole.com/blog/an-introduction-to-robust-first-computation/). It's more important than being correct or efficient.

## Local-first computing

Your stuff works [locally](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) by default, but also works well online.

## Permacomputing

Be [sustainable](https://permacomputing.net/permacomputing/). But for real though!

## Perma-local-robust-first computing

It's easy, we just add them all together for the **BEST computing**.
