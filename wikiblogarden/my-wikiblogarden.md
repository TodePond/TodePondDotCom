# My wiki / blog / digital garden

[Todepond dot com](/) is my wiki or blog or digital garden.

I made it because Devine told me to. Let me explain what happened...

## Devine

I was chatting with [Devine](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html) on a video call. And I mentioned how they might be interested in learning about Dave Ackley's work on robust-first computing. They asked me if there was a link I could give them to let them learn more.

I realised that I didn't have one link in particular... But in my head, I knew of lots of great things to watch, read, and explore. Unfortunately, it was all hidden away in my head.

So Devine told me to make a wiki, and here we are.

## Matt

[Matt Webb](https://interconnected.org/home/) told me a similar thing. I was telling him how I had so many thoughts floating round my head about some of the things I had learned recently. He suggested that I "write it down".

I think he's a hardcore blogger.

He told me he got into blogging in the "early days". I didn't know that was a thing. I didn't know people were so 'into' blogging, or wikis. They didn't seem like special things to me.

But maybe they are!

## Maggie

[Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) makes the case for 'digital gardening' on her website.

I think a digital garden is something that you grow. It's full of your thoughts, discoveries, knowledge, and whatever you want to grow. Her site is beautiful, and she goes all-in on the gardening.

## Elliot

I've also seen it done on a smaller scale. Like on [Elliot Evans](https://elliot.website/editor/)'s website. He often posts up unfinished pages. They end with something like "to be continued" or start with something like "this page is under construction". But they're *there*. They're uploaded on his website, not sitting around in his private notes.

## Me

As a general theme, [my](#) wiki / blog / digital garden is about 'merging things together'. I'm so tired of seeing new ideas pop up. We have enough of them! 

*No more ideas.* (say it with me)

I want to merge things together. I see these three concepts, and I see the same things in each of them. Sure there are differences. There always are. But I want to pull them closer together, and introduce people onto the same page.

The merging of ideas has always interested me, and it's how I started my creative coding journey (spatial programming + falling sand). It's the running thread between all my projects and videos. The clearest example is maybe the latest one, Define Define.

Anyway, I should stop yapping away. Hopefully you now know what my website is about:

> NO MORE IDEAS.
> WE HAVE ENOUGH.

(merge them instead)
