# Peace, a year later

It's christmas day, just like [last year](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/genocide/peace/christmas/).

I'm still not religious and I still do christmas. And there's still not peace.

Unsurprisingly, my wish for peace did not work. In fact, it's only getting worse / a lot worse.

## Peace

How privileged I am that I can sit and wish for peace at christmas.

What a load of good nothing that did. My thoughts and prayers are useless. My ideas are useless!

Gaza is being destroyed. My friends are watching their family and home go through genocide. And here I am doing nothing. I bet you're the same. 

Ukraine is still under attackâ€” and I remember all the displaced Syrian families I met during my teaching days. And I wonder how they're doing. And the rising numbers of homeless people I pass all the time. And the persecuted queer people of my country and others, including Palestine, including Ukraine. And the climate refugees that have fled or will soon. And all the others I am too ignorant to know about but I should.

And fuck the evil nob-heads that make things worse!!!!!!!!

## Peace

I guess there's no reason not to wish for peace. Wishes are cheap. I may as well. 

But I'm under no disillusion that it will work. 

## Peace

We live in a cruel cruel cruel cruel cruel world, built on violence and expansion and control.

Let this be the year that I finally pull my finger out my arse and my head out the sand and do something for fucks sake mate!!!!!

NO MORE SAND\
WE HAVE ENOUGH
