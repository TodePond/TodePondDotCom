# My website is not tadi

Nothing on my website is 100% local-first, so nothing on my website is 100% tadi. This is a big problem. 

<br>

<hr>

<br>

Most of it is *partially* local-first. Many pages of it use some sort of local store of *some* of the data. But if you're totally offline, it totally doesn't work.

So what's the solution? 

<br>

<hr>

<br>

The standard way to get websites to work offline is through a "progressive web app", often [acronym'd](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/style/never/use/acronyms/) as "PWA". 

However...

Progressive web apps are really fiddly and buggy and bad, and they work differently in every browser, and they're hard to maintain. 

So what to do? 

<br>

<hr>

<br>

Is there a way to progressive web apps in a radically simple way? Can you do it tadi style?

Or is another route possible? Can we somehow get a website working locally through some other means? 

No no no no no no no no no no no no no I'm not writing native code. I already figured that one out. Native code is hardest to resurrect. It's very un-tadi. So I'm not interested. 

<br>

Anyway, that's it.
