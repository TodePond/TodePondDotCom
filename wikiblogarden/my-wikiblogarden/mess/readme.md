# My wikiblogarden is a mess

It's a mess

completely overgrown, full of weeds, tools left lying on the ground.

the list of posts on the [main page](/wikiblogarden) is far too long, with some gaps, and the [contents section](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/#topics) is all out of date. 

my [feed maker](/feed/maker) is buggy now, and it puts things in the wrong order.

the [lab](/lab) is getting too long too, with all the categories getting used the wrong way.

and so what? i don't care how messy it is. it all still works.

i see some people thinking they have to be clean. "it has to be perfect!" and they end up cleaning and cleaning and rebuilding and rebuilding and organising and formatting and so on and

sometimes i see people stop! they stop working on what they're working, or they stop sharing "just until i can clean things up"

"i can't possibly show my mess"

and i think that's tragic because those people end up sharing and publishing absolutely nothing. they share nothing at all.

muthafrogger i am still here, sharing my mess, and it's fine! it's fine! it's fine!
