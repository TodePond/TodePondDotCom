# Defining the era

the post-AI era will be defined by those who define it, not by those who wait for it to happen

for me, post-AI means: fuck off ai music

AI has arrived. it may leave. it may stay. either way, fuck off AI music

AI may or may not be helpful to some people. AI may or may not become good at what it does.

it doesn't matter to me. whatever the case, fuck off AI music

small model, big model, local or cloud, it doesn't matter. whatever the case, be proud to say: fuck off ai music

this is what "post-AI" means to me: it means it doesn't matter what shape it comes in / what colour it is / who owns it / whether it works or not

even if it makes the world better, I'll still believe it: fuck off ai music. fuck off ai music. fuck off ai music.

post-AI means not needing to explain myself. "fuck off ai music". this is the truth I live. i breathe it! you'll have to kill me!

you may or may not understand! i don't care to tell you because enough people understand already. i don't want to convince you. i want you to leave. you're not wanted here: not by me.

fuck off! fuck off!\
fuck off ai music!

the post-AI world won't happen on its own. we have to make it: we have to make it happen

so fuck off ai music! good or bad, helpful or harmful, big or small, local or cloud, fun or boring, smart or dumb, if you're asking me: every single ai music can fuck right off!
