# free open source software needs fewer engineers

free open source software needs fewer engineers and more designers and product people

writing code should not be the primary way of contributing to free open source software

this post was inspired by checking out a load of discord "alternatives"

"[just] use IRC"
"[just] use a forum"
"[just] self-host by shushing into your prill scropt. it's easy you [just] prantiss a few cuntwobs. what's the big deal? there's no excuse. [just] spin up a brosh instance."

we gave the tech nerds too much power

but okay, how do we fix this?

we need to make space for design and product work within collaborative open source software somehow. there's PLENTY of space to walk into if you're a dev: make an issue / make a pull request / make a fork / use a package / blah blah blah

but there's none if you're a designer / producty person. what do you do??????

the industry does not work like this at all! but open source completely omits product design

is it as simple as surfacing the figma file of your open source project as highly as your repo?

can we start the readme with our user stories instead of "how to run locally"?

should we use project tracking? should we A/B test??

should we moodboard????
