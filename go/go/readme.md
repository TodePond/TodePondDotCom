# The best way to write a blog post

I can't quite believe it! it's finally here

as we approach two years of the wikiblogardenite, i finally find myself stumbling across problems that i've had from the [very start](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/my-wikiblogarden/hosting/journey/)

i feel a whole range of emotions around this. i feel wonderful. i feel alive. i feel relieved. i feel confused. i feel annoyed. and many more emotions!

mostly i feel like an idiot for not spotting this option ages ago.

## Write your blog from your phone

As you all know, I write my blog [from my phone](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/art/never-stop-writing/on-your-phone). This has always been the best way for me (and You!). It lets me whip it out and start or continue writing at any time. It lets me catch those moments of fleeting inspiration and blah blah blah (I explain it better in that linked post)

But writing in my phone notes app has some downsides too. For a start, it's not publicly Open or Live, which means I lose out on the potential immediate connection I get from writing / "performing"(?) my blog post writing Live.

Sure, I trained myself to write in a Live way with things like [dashes](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/scrappy-fiddles/sharing/normalising/handwriting). but I could always fake it... and it wasn't the same as Actually Writing Live.

Secondly... writing in my notes app is less appealing and more intimidating than [just] tooting on social media, so I often lost some potentially blog-worthy material to the toots. Sometimes I've even copy pasted stuff from toots to [posts](https://www.todepond.com/sky/liveness)

Microblogging apps are designed from the ground up to be creatively unblocking. There are very few [emotional blockers](https://www.todepond.com/report/arroost/) when it comes to microblogging apps. That's a good thing! It helps normalise sharing scrappy fiddles. So... why not make the most of it?

## Introducing Todepond Go

I made a new tool (oh no!) called [Todepond Go](https://todepond.com/go). It lets me create the contents of a blog post from a series of toots by selecting the final toot of a thread. I coded it entirely on my phone muthafrockrrr

I'm planning more features for it too. I think it could automatically detect when I toot "back to the wikiblogardenite" and turn it into a blog post. if I do that, it'll probably be a new tool, not an upgrade of the same one (tadi represent)

---

i LOVE LOVE LOVE todepond go: it's tadi web: it's SUPER indie web. it's so dumb and open and Live and recursive and it's gonna lead to me writing a lot lot lot more

one day it might even let me do [images](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/my-wikiblogarden/pictures/serious/)

## Complex feelings

In some ways this feels like an innovation but in some ways it doesn't? if anything it's more like an un-innovation, like I'm refusing to use the tools that would make this more complicated. i REFUSE to make it complicated. we live in the fuckin future with these stupidly powerful god machines in our pockets sapping up lightning from the fuckin air and it's still so stupidly complicated to do the simplest of things like write text into a website from your phone

In some ways I think this is caused by capitalist market forces. if they made it easier to do things freely, then they couldn't make so much money off you by LOCKING YOU IN

In some other ways, I think humans [just] feel an aversion to making things simple. Everyone wants to be or seem smart or "good" or talented or clever or efficient or creative or something or some nonsense like that.

I don't want that! I want to be stupid! I want to do stupid things! I want to do stupid things! I want to do stupid things! I want to [do stupid things](https://www.todepond.com/sky/do-stupid-things)!

Back to the wikiblogardenite.
