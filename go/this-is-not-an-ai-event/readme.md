# This is not an AI event

One of the most common questions I get asked about events like AlgoRhythms is "is this AI?" like that one bartender who came downstairs at the Sekforde and asked us "are you making music with AI?"

So, to me, it feels appropriate to clarify that this isn't an AI event: It's a live coding event, and "hey come here let me show you what that means"

That doesn't mean that no AI gets used at the event. After all, it's usually an open format, so you're never quite sure what people will bring along, and I've certainly seen a whole range of different AI things at london live coding events: Some old school (hooray!), some new school (boo!)

But no matter what: The focus of the event is live coding. It's not an AI event in the same sense that it's not a trance music event, but that won't stop me performing trance music at every single AlgoRhythms! Doof doof doof doof doof doof doof

Ideas like "post-AI" can be interesting topics to explore, especially in academic settings. However, for the beginner discovering our community, I think it [just] makes things more complicated.

"So wait it's not a live coding event, it's a post-AI event? so it *is* an AI event?"

But on the other hand, the "This is not an AI event" statement can make some people worry that their old-school AI stuff (hooray) is not welcome (oh no!)

## So what should we do?

I don't know, but personally I'm part of the [fuck off AI music movement](https://www.todepond.com/sky/fuck-off-ai-music/)
