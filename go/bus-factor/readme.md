the tadi web is when you try to adhere to every single better computing movement out there and the way you do that is by adopting an approach where your computing code is not the valuable thing to you or your practices anymore and so you lose all reliance and all connection to your code by adopting what we call a slippy mindset which is where you completely remove the cost of losing code in any way you can and one way you can do that is by developing robustness by developing redundancy by crea—

—ting copies of instructions of how to create the code you lost but it has to be from scratch because the instructions to make that code are also code but we refer to it as natural code because it's intended to be transmitted from people to people and either way the slippy mindset acknowledges that we could lose that too so you need to not be fucked if that happens and one way of doing that is by storing code with other people and even better those people could also store that code with other p—

—eople too like a forkbomb so you better hope it's code worth transmitting because if you do it right it will spread so for sure it's worth installing some self-destruct sequence in it just in case it mutates into something bad so that your slippy code doesn't get sticky such as something like "let code die" which can make code stay unprecious so that people still judge it as it comes in and goes out though of course this does subject you to the whims of other people but this is part of the agr—

—eement when you use existing networks like this and build your own on them with the goal of persisting code in case yours dies but it's definitely worth it because then it becomes not only unkillable but also ever changing and growing and therefore adhering to the tadi web.
