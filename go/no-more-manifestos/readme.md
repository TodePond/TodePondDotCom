# No more manifestos

We have enough.

"I don't know about you but I'm kinda sick of manifestos"

That's what I said in my talk at ICLC but you wouldn't know that unless you were there because they still haven't released the recordings yet which is kinda ironic seeing as it's a conference about liveness.

I kinda expected that though, so I recorded my own talk myself, but I intentionally did a shoddy job of it because I wanted my attention to be on the people in the room. And I had a plan for any mistakes I might make:

If I really value liveness, then I can [just](https://xoxo.zone/@annika/115017302076971618) DO IT AGAIN right?

so I redelivered my talk at the end of a nine and a half hour [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/live/7U0PYAOkp4Q?si=mti6hDVNXdp9KTpy) and some people watched me do it: live. A small number of people watched the entire thing, a large number of people watched that part only. One person started watching at the start, then left to go graduate at their graduation ceremony, then came back to watch the end (we were still going).

## Manifestos

What's the point of a manifesto? it could be many things I think. It could be a statement of your values, or a list of demands, or a call to action, or a set of rules or guidelines: It could be anything, I think. Right?

> I am trying to get across more of my uncertainty in my writing

```
Of course, we can understand a manifesto as a piece of natural code, of course.
```

when not acted upon, a manifesto means and does nothing. but more often than not, a manifesto *does* get acted upon (`implemented`). Take the non-draft [draft manifesto](https://toplap.org/wiki/ManifestoDraft) of live coding. (Sorry I can't say the manifesto's full name because it contains an acronym and I know what it stands for, and I promised to [never use acronyms](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/style/never/use/acronyms/) when I know what it stands for, even if it's a parody.

The non-draft draft manifesto has been very successful. Lots of people (including me) quote it as being guiding to their practices.

## Promises

Promises are similar to manifestos except they can't help but be implemented. After you've said a promise, you'll either keep that promise or you won't. There is no escaping that.

Promises are like manifestos except they're more interpersonal. They're about the relationship between me and you. I am promising YOU something. It doesn't [just] get declared to the void.

Promises are like manifestos except they don't warrant an explanation: They don't need to be correct because they aren't explicitly making any statement on what's important. Where manifestos are abstract / refer to people more generally, promises are specific and personal.

"This is what I am promising. I probably have my reasons for it. Take it or leave it."

Promises are like manifestos except they help us to collaborate better because they make us more predictable. I can assure you that I will do something, which gives you some more knowledge of the future, which helps you plan and work with me. (A life ago, I was doing psychology at university running experiments on this idea.)

Promises are like manifestos expect they're less pompous.

But mainly........

A promise is like a MANIFESTO expect it fits into [two beat style](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/style/two-beat).

No matter what a promise is or isn't, I hand-on-my-heart promise you that I will never ever ever never ever (not at any point in my life)â€”

I promise you that I will never write a MANIFESTO.
