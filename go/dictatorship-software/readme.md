# Dictatorship software

every single free open source project suffers from the same problem: pull requests take way too long to get reviewed

the only exception is #pastagang, which has completely solved this problem, and i mean this completely unironically

more projects should adopt jam-oriented programming

you don't even need to go all the way. you could [just] reduce the scope of reviewing all the way down to a security check, instead of being obsessed with code QUALITY or whether it matches your "benevolent" dictator's vision or not

if your Free open source software is limited by one or more dictators then it's not Free

if your software truly belongs to the public then give it to the public lol

the worst part is that if you decide to take matters into your own hand by forking or deploying something yourself then people get weird and suspicious about it, despite this being completely allowed and okay

this is a subtoot of this thread on the supercollider forum

ultimately it's about power and wanting to be in charge of one version of one thing.

here are some suggestions:

- don't just deploy/release the latest version of your tool. deploy ALL versions and let the person choose which one they want.
- don't try to maintain only one branch. pluralism is good! let there be many forks and directions for many different things!
- merge every idea, ESPECIALLY the ones you don't like, because it'll end up surprising you and taking you to new nice places
- merge bugs and issues. fix them after if they matter. leave them in if they don't

this is an opportunity to remind you that i now follow jam-oriented programming principles in all my code repos (except dreamberd). i *will* merge your pull request with minimal or no checks
