# Frequently asked questions

## How do you write your blog?

I write my blog posts on mastodon.

## How do you publish your blog posts?

I copy paste it: I copy things from my mastodon using a tool i made on my phone called [todepond go](https://todepond.com/go). Then I make a new readme file somewhere in my repo from my phone, and I paste it there.

## How do you update your RSS feed?

I made a tool called [wikiblogarden feed maker 2](https://www.todepond.com/feed/maker/2/) where I can write down what I want in the feed and it copies the entire feed to my clipboard. Then I paste it to replace the old RSS file's contents. I do all this from my phone.

## Why are you vegetarian?

I am vegetarian because I don't want animals to be killed in my name. it is not for [any other reason](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/my-name/vegetarian/).

## Why are you slowly becoming vegan?

I am becoming vegan because I don't want animals to be mistreated in my name and being vegan is a socially accepted way of saying "no" to a lot of things.

I am only *slowly* becoming vegan because it's a big change for me and I don't want to fail. I know lots of friends and family who were fully vegan for a few years and then gave up and I don't want to do that: I want it to stick.

## How long will it take to be fully vegan?

The process will never end but the area of the universe in which I'm vegan will keep expanding.

1st year: I am vegan at home and at work.
2nd year: Vegan in London.
3rd year: Vegan in the UK.
4th year: Vegan in Europe.
5th year: Vegan on planet Earth.
6th year: Vegan in the solar system.
7th year: Vegan in the Milky Way.
8th year: Vegan in the universe.
9th year: Vegan in the multiverse.
10th year: Vegan in the timeline.
11th year: Vegâ€”

## But what if you leave London?

I will never leave London.

## Why do you like London?

Because London is where stuff is happening and I like the tube.

## That's a very London-centric answer

It was a very London-centric question! and this one isn't even a question.

## Is torn leaf zero actually happening or is it like a social experiment to see if people send you stuff?

This is a very common question and it's real but it's taking a long time

## Is top 99 ways to make sand cancelled?

No, I'm still working on it

## Are you burnt out like most YouTubers?

No

## Why don't you do weekly todepond pondcasts any more?

I feel less motivation to do them because I've since found other ways of communicating with my paying supporters, such as this frequently asked questions posts. However, I will keep doing them, just less regularly

## Why don't you charge more for your patreon? You could be making more money

For me it's more important that people are paying full-stop so that they can be part of the community. Growing that number is more important to me right now

## The cheapest tiers on patreon are all taken now. Please can you let me join one of them?

No, but if you want to pay less, you can do it on [liberapay](https://liberapay.com/todepond) or you could manually pay me every now and then at [todepond.com/pay](https://todepond.com/pay).

my paid content isn't protected in anyway: i trust you to pay the right amounts (minimum 1 pound per month on average)

## Why don't you sell merch?

I have plans to sell merch but I want it to be good and a big deal and more similar to buying art than buying products. I've been asking for feedback on what you'd be interested in and how much you'd pay

## How do you balance your art practice with all this money-making and self-promotion?

The money-making and self-promotion *is* the art practice dumbass

## Why do you insult your supporters on social media?

I think it's funny to contrast/parody the usual fake influencer positivity with this. I started doing it when supporters started becoming a lot more demanding of me and I found it to be an interesting dynamic: To make me a bit of a villain in the story, where the characters like berd and tode are the good guys

## Can I read this FAQ if I'm not a paying supporter?

Yes, you can read this frequently asked questions post even if you're not a paying supporter

## Can we meet up in real life?

No.

I do plenty of events in London and around the world where you can meet me. Why don't you come to one of them?

## I don't want to come to one of them, I want to hang out with you

## Hello?

## Please respond

## Hello??? Lu please answer

## I'm sorry if I upset you and ruined our friendship
