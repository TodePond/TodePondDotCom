# The wikiblogardenite turns two years old

Two years ago, I started my wikiblogardenite. Let's do a recap of year number two.

## Just

For the second year in a row, the most viewed post was [Just](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/).

The second most viewed post was [Dialogues on natural code](https://www.todepond.com/code/): The release of the paper I wrote with Dave Ackley.

And in third place, it was [Splash](https://todepond.com/lab/splash), my first explainable.

## Trans-posting

The posts about being trans continued, and they continued to be some of my most viewed posts, the clear winner being [The pros and cons of coming out as trans*](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/genocide/coming-out/pros-and-cons/).

I still haven't given you a full [Glimpse of feeling trans](https://www.todepond.com/sky/a-glimpse-of-feeling-trans/) but I did anger a few people with my thoughts on [Normal gender feelings](https://todepond.com/wikiblogardenite/normal-gender-feelings).

I also wrapped up the [Lu loo tales](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/health/loo-lu/end/) for the second time with [Let me use the loo](https://www.todepond.com/sky/let-me-piss/).

## Stupid poems

I continued to write stupid poems, with [Do stupid things](https://todepond.com/sky/do-stupid-things) scoring surprisingly highly.

My parents put [Yourself](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/my-name/self/) in a frame and gave it to me as a gift.

## C-bomb count

My posts have definitely got angrier and more sweary, with [The internet can be good](https://www.todepond.com/sky/the-internet-can-be-good/) scoring a new personal best for vulgarity.

But maybe that's okay because, after all, [Sometimes rage is the right response](https://www.todepond.com/sky/sometimes-rage-is-the-right-response).

The idiosyncrasies of my wikiblogardenite have continued / evolved with the—

I started using [Slashes](https://www.todepond.com/sky/slashes) / straying off-topic partway through a post because [Everything in our life is hierarchical, even blog posts](https://www.todepond.com/blogarch). Or are they? Because I've also participated in a lot of [pastagang blog](https://pastagang.cc/blog) posts this year.

I infamously *didn't* write [Origins of "let code die"](https://www.pastagang.cc/blog/let-code-die/origins/) but I *did* write [By pastagang](https://www.pastagang.cc/blog/by-pastagang/). Or did I?

In pastagang, I think I enjoy being a documentarian (is that a word?). I like watching it all happen and cheering it all on and recording what I see. I feel like a mega-fan writing up a fan wiki in scarily high detail. In that sense, I enjoy writing posts like [All the flok clients](https://www.pastagang.cc/blog/every-single-flok-client/) and [Mantras](https://www.pastagang.cc/blog/mantras/) that are essentially big lists. I love a big list.

## Todepond Go

I now write most of my blog posts as threads on mastodon. I use my tool, [Todepond Go](https://www.todepond.com/go/) to turn it into a blog post. I really think this is [The best way to write a blog post](https://www.todepond.com/go/go/) because it lets me be extremely live and open.

[I am an unreliable narrator](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/reliable-narrator/) though and I often make mistakes, so being this live and open can have harmful effects. [Dictatorship software](https://www.todepond.com/go/dictatorship-software/) was quite badly received, which was bad for various reasons. However, I did learn a lot from it and it prepared me well for my talk at ADC a week or so later, which went down well. Was it worth it? I don't know. I think time will tell.
