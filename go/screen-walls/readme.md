# Screen walls

Some people who follow along with my stuff on the web will have a pretty bad picture of who I am: One of those people met me this weekend at a meetup. They found out that I'm not as calm as I am on [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mbs0sx3z2A)

Those people who know me in real life know i get very EXCITED very fast and I'm quite loud and manic

But still, if you only know me through events like meetups and gigs and CONFERENCES where I do talks and demos and PERFORMANCES you still [don't know me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4OIcwt8vcE) at all.

And I don't know you, reader, I don't know you at all!

My FAVOURITE kind of art is the kind of art where I really get to know someone better: Where they manage to imbue their thing or process with so much PERSONALITY that it can't help but be theirs: It can't POSSIBLY be someone else's.

But it goes further than that too

It's about getting inside your head/heart. To get to know you, I need to see and feel what it's like to live inside your head. Let me UNDERSTAND the world / the you from inside you / the world

There is no need to convince me of ANYTHING. I want to know what it's like to be you

There is no need to be good: In fact, you must not be good: You must not be good, because then you'll have smoothed off the rough edges of you and your FINGERPRINT. I want to read words written in *your* shitty HANDWRITING: In *your* font, even if it's hard to read / ESPECIALLY if it's hard to read. I want to see *your* SILHOUETTE, not your cardboard cutout's.

I don't want pseudo INTELLECTUAL bullshit. I don't want GRANDIOSE claims. I don't want DISATTACHED ACADEMIC papers. I don't want OBJECTIVE / TECHNICALLY correct statements,

i want *you*: i want the SUBJECTIVE INCORRECT messy *you*, dear reader, i want you!
