# Pigeon in a box

i notice that many anti-AI people make claims that "AI will *not* take your job" and actually seem quite appalled at anyone claiming otherwise. they think "you're benefitting the AI companies by leaning into AI doomerism" or something.

and I gotta say, knowing first-hand that so many of my artist friends are getting jobs cut or dropped or replaced by AI... these anti-AI people piss me the hell off.

your denial of reality does not help the cause.

<br>

don't turn me into the guy from [don't look up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Look_Up). disaster is coming! just like it always has been. your wishful thinking does not change that.

it doesn't take much to automate a job. the suits *want* to do it: they just need an excuse. they don't care about how *good* something is. they care about *margins* and they'll keep shrinking them until it self-destructs their own business, at which point they'll be taken over by the next negative money growth-backed bubble bus

your need to feel special and different from a machine changes nothing about that. there is nothing about you that can't and won't be automated by the suits, for better and worse.

YES YES I KNOW that you SHOULDN'T be automated but that is very extremely different from what CAN and WILL happen in reality: on capitalist planet earth.

<br>

they don't need AI to automate you, but it sure does help. fields that were previously hard to self-checkout-ize have become easy. the water level has moved beyond a threshold where your livelihood can be argued against in a board room. this is the truth.

and i don't need to know why because i can see it happening to my friends. i don't need to argue or make a case about the nature of artificial intelligence and whether it's "really" "real" "intelligence" or [just] a bunch of number neurons running through a machine (*which I'm totally not by the way*) because:

> i'm just a pigeon in a skinner's box world

and it makes no difference how the bird food appears

like our AI bro brethren before us, we can look at AI as a black box and assess it for what it does:

no matter what's inside:

- AI takes work away from my friends.
- AI gives more power to suits, less to workers.
- AI makes us reliant on big tech companies that totally have our best interests at heart.

i don't need to know anything else to know that.

<br>

*maybe*, if our world was better, then AI could be helpful. maybe we could finally automate our boring tasks and take the day off and do *more* art! but we don't live in that world. maybe *you* do, but i don't, and my friends sure don't either.

## conclusion

[we are not special](https://www.todepond.com/sky/special/). [ai is good and bad](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/worse-computing/artificial-intelligence/bad/good/).
