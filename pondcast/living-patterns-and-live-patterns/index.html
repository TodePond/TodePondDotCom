    TODEPOND PONDCAST: Living patterns
  </h1>

  <p>
    Well then! It&#39;s time for another weekly‚Äî No, they&#39;re really not
    weekly, are they. They haven&#39;t been weekly for a while. It really is
    because of how busy I&#39;ve been. First I was in Belgium, then I was in
    Berlin, then I was in Los Angeles, and last week... Last week I was at a
    wedding. So here we are with another non-weekly episode of the...
  </p>
  <p>üê∏ TODEPOND PONDCAST üê∏</p>
  <p>
    I&#39;m tradition, it&#39;ll be double length, to make sure we keep the
    streak going.
  </p>
  <p>What&#39;s new?</p>
  <img src="1.png" />
  <h2 id="living-patterns">Living patterns</h2>
  <p>
    Great news! My submission to
    <a href="https://iclc.toplap.org/2025/">ICLC</a> got accepted!
  </p>
  <p>
    I told you about it
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/pondcast/past-and-present-and-future/"
      >last time</a
    >, but I submitted a workshop to a live coding conference in Barcelona and I
    got accepted. And of course, I&#39;m really pleased.
  </p>
  <p>
    One reviewer gave me a score of 30, which means a &quot;strong
    acceptance&quot;, and the other one gave me a score of 20, which means an
    &quot;acceptance&quot;, but not a strong one or weak one, just a normal one.
    I have no idea what the maximum score is. If it&#39;s one hundred, that
    would be really bad, so it&#39;s probably not.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyway, yes, I&#39;m relieved that the reviewers seemed to &#39;get it&#39;,
    and also daunted that I now need to prepare a workshop. The submission
    itself needed to be quite detailed, so I&#39;ve prepared quite a lot
    already. So... the workshop is ready, but I am not, so I better get
    cracking.
  </p>

  <h2 id="natural-code">Natural code</h2>
  <p>
    Speaking of submissions, the
    <a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a> programming conference has
    now officially ended.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, this means that our paper,
    <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3689492.3689807"
      >Dialogues on natural code</a
    >
    has now stopped being freely available. You now have to pay money to access
    it. And none of that money goes to me or my co-author,
    <a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu/~ackley/">Dave Ackley</a>. Quite the
    opposite! We had to pay large amounts of money ourselves, just for this
    thing to be sold by and for someone else. It&#39;s utterly ridiculous.
  </p>
  <p>
    I&#39;m allowed to post up a pre-print of the paper on my personal website,
    and I will be doing that. But I think I&#39;d like to create a bit of
    interest in the paper, and kind of... raise awareness of the fact that so
    much science is hidden behind paywalls for the vast majority of the
    world&#39;s population.
  </p>
  <p>
    Regardless of all this, I&#39;m still very pleased that I did write this
    paper with Dave. It was a great experience on the whole and I learned
    bucketloads. But that doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t aspects worth
    criticising!
  </p>
  <p>Anyway... I&#39;ll have a think.</p>

  <h2 id="logiverse">Logiverse</h2>
  <p>
    Here&#39;s an update from the
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/explore/tadi-web/">tadi web</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A while ago, I made a little microblogging experiment called
    <a href="/lab/login">Login</a> to practise some skills. It&#39;s a mini
    clone of something like bluesky or mastodon but much much worse.
  </p>
  <p>
    The fun part of being part of the tadi web is that it&#39;s really easy for
    other people to build stuff with it or on top of it too. And that&#39;s what
    happened.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many other community members have built their own versions of the Login
    site, and all of these different sites are now talking to each other. This
    means you can post on one site, and it&#39;ll appear on all the others. It
    shares the load of power across the network. It&#39;s a distributed system.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are also various custom clients, like one called
    <a href="https://tristie.org/logarithm/">Logarithm</a> that lets you log in
    to any other site. And some people have made clients that let them
    <a href="https://xoxo.zone/@annika/113136710954037798"
      >post from the command line</a
    >
    on their computer. And there&#39;s even an
    <a href="https://github.com/cute-catgirl/Loft">iPhone app</a>!
  </p>
  <p>
    Together, all of these different things make up the
    <a href="https://logiverse.social">Logiverse</a> so I made a little
    <a href="https://logiverse.social">signpost website</a> to help to introduce
    it to people.
  </p>
  <p>
    Interest in Login seems to fluctuate, with each wave getting more exciting
    than the last, so I&#39;m looking forward to what happens next. It
    definitely feels like the next chapter of my
    <a href="/explore/tadi-web">tadi web</a> work.
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <p><em>And now... part two...</em></p>
  <h1 id="todepond-pondcast-live-patterns">TODEPOND PONDCAST: Live patterns</h1>
  <p>What else is new?</p>
  <img src="4.png" />
  <h2 id="pasta-gang">Pasta gang</h2>
  <p>
    I have continued participating in &quot;pastagang&quot;, the collaborative
    music making that I introduced
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/pondcast/past-and-present-and-future/"
      >last time</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many sessions have been recorded and uploaded to this
    <a
      href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9uRa69RF-7wOS5CnK0wy34t5HYgFLIng&amp;si=dLsVggmRa92PXfUS"
      >youtube playlist</a
    >. You can see us get better (and worse) over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://midirus.com/">Tristan de Cacqueray</a> has started
    <a href="https://midirus.com/project/pastagang">editing and remixing</a> the
    improvised tracks that we end up making.
  </p>
  <p>
    And a couple of pastagang participants (<a href="https://guedelhoefer.dev/"
      >Hannes G√ºdelh√∂fer</a
    >
    and <a href="https://veralin.dk/">Anders Kaare</a>) have submitted
    <a href="https://github.com/munshkr/flok/pull/300">improvements</a> to
    <a href="https://flok.cc">flok</a>, the collaboration tool that we use, made
    by <a href="https://social.toplap.org/@munshkr">Dami√°n Silvani</a>. And
    great news!
    <a href="https://github.com/munshkr/flok/pull/301">One of them</a> has been
    accepted and merged
  </p>
  <p>
    I&#39;ve also started a very long
    <a
      href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/learn/pastagang/accident/arroost/"
      >write-up</a
    >
    of my pastagang experience so far. I&#39;m writing and releasing it bit by
    bit.
  </p>
  <img src="5.png" />
  <h2 id="london-live-coding">London live coding</h2>
  <p>
    I finally managed to attend a London live coding meetup this week! And of
    course, I showed <a href="/explore/arroost">Arroost</a> to some people
    there. But I also showed them pastagang and the
    <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9uRa69RF-7wOS5CnK0wy34t5HYgFLIng"
      >collaborations</a
    >
    we&#39;ve been doing.
  </p>
  <p>
    And I invited everyone to join in and jump into the collaborative
    environment with their laptops. And it was mad! I&#39;ve never seen so many
    people editing one visual / one sound all together at the same time. There
    were a bunch of people who joined remotely too.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was pure chaos and carnage, and we crashed the thing a few times by
    accident, but it was very exciting too. I&#39;ve never done anything like
    that before.
  </p>
  <p>
    One day later, a Slovenian live coding meetup did the same thing! Except,
    this time, I was one of the remote participants. It was mad fun. They went
    so intense.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think there&#39;s something special about these moments of long distance
    collaboration. I don&#39;t yet know what it really is but it feels like
    stars aligning! I&#39;m going to investigate further.
  </p>
  <img src="6.png" />
  <h2 id="there-s-no-one-else-left">There&#39;s no one else left</h2>
  <p>I should give you a little update about the future.</p>
  <p>
    People are still waiting for me to do Torn Leaf Zero, the first exhibition
    of <a href="https://tornleaf.gallery/">Torn Leaf</a>, and I&#39;m working on
    it! At some point, I&#39;m going to contact all entrants to give them an
    update. I know how to do it justice, and I&#39;m working on it.
  </p>
  <p>
    And I&#39;m still working on the next video, Top 99 Ways To Make Sand.
    I&#39;m still working towards a trailer, and I&#39;ve been iterating on the
    pacing of that.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://floracaulton.com/">Flora</a>&#39;s been working on some
    animation for it, and you might get a sneak peak if you follow her on her
    <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/floramus.bsky.social">bluesky</a> or
