    TODEPOND PONDCAST: Good is not enough
  </h1>

  <p>Welcome, again, to the...</p>
  <p>üê∏ TODEPOND PONDCAST üê∏</p>
  <p>What&#39;s new this week?</p>
  <img src="1.png" />
  <h2 id="login">Login</h2>
  <p>
    In my continued explorations of radical simplicity, as part of the
    <a href="https://tadiweb.com">tadi web</a>, I continue to make tiny little
    experiments, and I share them in my
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/lab/">tadi lab</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This week, I made a little experiment that got a little more attention than
    usual. It&#39;s called
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/lab/login/">Login</a>, and you can log in
    to it by typing in a username and a password, as long as the username
    isn&#39;t already taken.
  </p>
  <p>
    When logged in, you can update your status, which might sound like a
    familiar feature if you&#39;ve ever used twitter or facebook. But Login is
    different! Because you can only ever have one status. When you write a
    status, it replaces the old one.
  </p>
  <p>Another way it&#39;s different is that it looks like crap!</p>
  <p>
    It was fun to make. It&#39;s a de-make of a microblogging site, using some
    scrappy tricks I&#39;ve learned from my tadi web practice. People seemed to
    really enjoy using it too! And the funnest part for me is that... the code
    is so basic and minimal that lots of people have been submitting pull
    requests for it, adding custom styles and stuff to their name. I have a lot
    of pull requests to look through straight after recording this pondcast.

  <h2 id="feeling-good-is-not-enough">Feeling good is not enough</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/pondcast/boosh/">Last week</a> I told you
    that my
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/report/arroost/">essay on Arroost</a> got
    accepted for <a href="https://liveprog.org/#program">LIVE</a>, which is
    taking place later this year.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, let&#39;s start looking through some of the feedback I got! We&#39;ll
    start with the simplest and gradually get to the more complex and nuanced
    responses over the coming weeks
  </p>
  <p>Here we go...</p>
  <p>
    In the essay, I make the case for more limited tools, where there is less
    choice, like tldraw&#39;s limited colour palette picker. It means you spend
    less time wasting time, obsessing over trying to pick the perfect colour,
    and instead you just pick one and get back to creating things.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reviewer A had some concerns with this mentality. Here&#39;s what they
    wrote:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Sometimes the seemingly minor &quot;obsession&quot; work of finding the
      right color or arranging things on a canvas (when it doesn&#39;t really
      matter how they&#39;re arranged) can itself be <em>relaxing</em> (not
      always but can be). Japanese rock gardening is a great example of this. So
      there is an argument that &quot;designing for emotion&quot; or
      &quot;feeling&quot; more broadly is not what is being argued for here.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    And, yes, the reviewer is correct. My essay is <em>not</em> about
    &quot;improving your emotions&quot;. My essay is only about &quot;removing
    your emotional blockers&quot;, which is a very different task. I even wrote
    a paragraph about this difference, entitled &quot;Feeling good is not
    enough&quot;. I&#39;ll read it to you now:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I do see many researchers trying to make tools that &quot;feel good&quot;.
      But that&#39;s not enough. Sometimes, feeling good is not the same as
      feeling free from emotional blockers. Tackling your emotional needs is
      sometimes uncomfortable‚Äî it can be hard‚Äî it can make you feel bad, or
      frustrated, but I think it&#39;s worth it.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Removing emotional blockers can feel bad. It can feel very unrelaxing or
    anxiety-inducing, because it often involves going outside your comfort zone.
  </p>
  <p>
    It all depends on your goals. Do you want to help the user feel good? Or do
    you want to help them create something? These are not the same.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyway, Reviewer A&#39;s feedback was very helpful because it shows me that
    I wasn&#39;t clear enough about this distinction. In the presentation,
    I&#39;ll try to be upfront about this :)
  </p>

  <h2 id="opening">Opening</h2>
  <p>Torn leaf!</p>
  <p>
    Do you remember <a href="https://tornleaf.gallery">Torn Leaf</a>? I
    announced it ages ago and I&#39;ve got loads of amazing submissions. (Thank
    you everyone). So you might be wondering what&#39;s happening with it. Where
    is the exhibition? Where is Torn Leaf Zero?
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, the truth is that the collective submissions ended up being so good
    that I felt like I really needed to do them justice in some way. My original
    very low-fi plans no longer matched up with the quality and breadth of the
    submitted works. So I&#39;ve been doing a lot of figuring out of what to do.
  </p>
  <p>And I now have plans in place!</p>
  <p>
    I am making a &quot;virtual gallery opening&quot; video to introduce the
    online exhibition, in the spirit of the kinds of things the
    <a href="https://youtu.be/G-gyzGqsWio?si=HzL7BrgZop8iqg5O">Met</a> and
    <a href="https://youtu.be/bT7i507OnOw?si=ZX1u1ca1gUZniB26">Tate Modern</a>
    put out. There&#39;s a real nice vibe to that genre of video and I&#39;ve
    been watching and studying them all. Torn Leaf&#39;s opening will be a kind
    of parody or variation on that usual format.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a while, I was wondering if Torn Leaf&#39;s whole exhibition needed to
    be a single video. It would be a guided tour of the entire thing, walking
    you through each piece from start to finish. But that always felt like a
    shame to me. I want the submissions to stand on their own, and not just be
    part of a bigger piece of media. I didn&#39;t want them to get squished up
    into a megamix of sorts.
  </p>
  <p>
    No, instead, the video will be a welcoming teaser, signposting the viewer to
    the online gallery page, hinting towards some of the significance of various
    pieces, or parts of the project.
  </p>
  <p>
    It will feature small snippets of works, and the context that brought them
    together.
  </p>
  <p>
    But words are cheap! I need to make the thing now. I have a clear vision
    now, and I&#39;ll do my best to execute it.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Step one:</strong> Make and publish the teaser for the next video,
    Top 99 Ways To Make Sand.<br /><strong>Step two:</strong> Wrap up and
    publish Torn Leaf Zero.
  </p>
