    TODEPOND PONDCAST: Century
  </h1>
  <p>Welcome back to another‚Äî</p>
  <p>
    These updates have stopped being weekly, which is bad. I hereby declare
    bankruptcy on keeping up to date with my deadlines. To get back on track,
    I&#39;m going to reduce the quality of these posts. I&#39;m pretty sure this
    will let me get back to a weekly cadence.
  </p>
  <p>Welcome back to the...</p>
  <p>üê∏ TODEPOND PONDCAST üê∏</p>
  <p>What&#39;s new?</p>
  <h2 id="dialogues-on-natural-code">Dialogues on natural code</h2>
  <p>
    I properly &quot;launched&quot; the paper I wrote with Dave Ackley. You can
    read the launch and the paper at <a href="/code">todepond.com/code</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It contains some reflections and warnings about publishing through the ACM.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks again to everyone who has contributed to the Living Computation
    Foundation at any point. You helped to support me and some of the costs I
    complained about in the <a href="/code">launch</a>.
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <p>
    Publishing a paper like this brings us some legitimacy. In Dave&#39;s
    <a href="https://youtu.be/E1F4kbNPWPM?si=MrxAEKDxWHebcjEC"
      >most recent update</a
    >, he mentioned how his progress meter has now moved onto the next stage.
    The previous milestone was, of course, being mocked by your
    <em>precious</em> Alan Kay.
  </p>
  <h2 id="two-two-two-two">Two two two two</h2>
  <p>
    I did a
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Zgq64ONM_5U?si=MzzgXZbDhAUm_qO0"
      >challenge livestream</a
    >. It was called Two Two Two Two.
  </p>
  <p>
    The challenge was to complete Ivan Reese&#39;s ridiculous 2222 game four
    times in two hours twenty two minutes and twenty two seconds. I started at
    two o&#39;clock.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have no idea what I&#39;m talking about then feel free to watch the
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Zgq64ONM_5U?si=MzzgXZbDhAUm_qO0"
      >full livestream</a
    >, although I doubt that would clear up much.
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <p>
    With the conclusion of this livestream, I now have three different
    &quot;formats&quot; of livestream that I can do. I think they&#39;re all
    pretty fun. In future livestreams, I can stick to these formats but up the
    ante.
  </p>
  <h2 id="top-99-ways-to-make-sand">Top 99 ways to make sand</h2>
  <p>Now the biggest news.</p>
  <p>
    I released a
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cmf09JjB8c">teaser trailer</a> for
    the next video, Top 99 Ways To Make Sand. Watch it now
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cmf09JjB8c">here</a>!
  </p>
  <p>
    I changed plans away from my original plans. I was originally going to use
    the first section of the final video for the teaser trailer. But that
    section involves some slightly fiddly effects, so it&#39;s not ready yet.
    Rather than hold back the trailer for longer, I decided to do it in a
    different way. And I&#39;m pleased I did! It ended up being a bigger deal in
    the end.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyway, that&#39;s it for this week! Thank you for being here... And
    wherever you are in the world... whatever you&#39;re doing... I hope you
    have a great week.
