    TODEPOND PONDCAST: What it means to be messy
  </h1>

  <p>Welcome back to another weekly episode of the...</p>
  <p>üê∏ TODEPOND PONDCAST üê∏</p>
  <p>What&#39;s new this week?</p>
  <img src="1.png" alt="Blur" />
  <h2 id="blur">Blur</h2>
  <p>
    I&#39;ve been working more on the next video, Top 99 Ways To Make Sand, and
    I&#39;ve been using heavy use of blur for a money shot in the intro.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      &quot;Money shot&quot; can mean different things (apparently) but I&#39;m
      using the meaning that means a shot of a film that&#39;s expensive to
      make, but considered important, or impactful to the film on the whole. For
      me, it usually means a long &quot;one shot&quot;.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &quot;One shot&quot; means a shot of a film that doesn&#39;t have any
        cuts in it. It&#39;s one continuous shot, like
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSt4UuVf2Pc">Birdman</a> and
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GczwQ47CffA"
          >Beyond the Infinite Two Minutes</a
        >.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Previous money shots include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The
        <a href="https://youtu.be/Q4OIcwt8vcE?si=s38PSbzS1iqHBnnA&amp;t=243"
          >dream sequence</a
        >
        of Screens.
      </li>
      <li>
        The
        <a href="https://youtu.be/gv40Z9tVjAI?si=eQZrOQuwhNEZNuLa&amp;t=170"
          >zoom sequences</a
        >
        of Cells.
      </li>
      <li>
        The
        <a href="https://youtu.be/DNBKdU6XrLY?si=Y82IyaZNOP-4R9VI&amp;t=392"
          >come out sequence</a
        >
        of Arrows.
      </li>
      <li>
        The
        <a href="https://youtu.be/DNBKdU6XrLY?si=QPMZDz_GLqWtO8PW&amp;t=42"
          >title sequence</a
        >
        of Arrows.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It feels like a required component of the
      <a
        href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9uRa69RF-7zF1PtGd4R0E0BI8uyzTgLH&amp;si=XK4aHwbqf24_81jw"
        >Things in Things in Things</a
      >
      series, and I&#39;m doing more and more of them as time goes on.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    I&#39;ve been using heavy use of blur for a money shot in the intro.
    Unfortunately, it looked kinda bad to start with. When I rendered the video,
    it gained loads of visual artifacts, so I tried a whole bunch of things,
    like changing rendering settings, tweaking the numbers, using a different
    tool.
  </p>
  <p>
    And I eventually made it better by switching to a combination of different
    blurs, instead of using just one. It also increased rendering speed a lot.
  </p>
  <img src="2.png" alt="Me talking" />
  <h2 id="talk-season">Talk season</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/talk/season/">Talk season</a> has started!
  </p>
  <p>I have four talks lined up in a very short space of time.</p>
  <p>
    First up, the
    <a href="https://2024.heartofclojure.eu/">Heart of Clojure</a> conference in
    Leuven in Belgium. I don&#39;t speak any clojure, but they&#39;re open
    minded enough to have me do the opening keynote anyway. Naturally, my talk
    is about openness. It&#39;s called
    <a href="https://2024.heartofclojure.eu/talks/what-it-means-to-be-open/"
      >WHAT IT MEANS TO BE OPEN</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then I&#39;m at
    <a href="https://berlin.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands</a> in Berlin to
    give a keynote about the
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/tadi-web/">tadi web</a>.
    It&#39;ll be my first time speaking about the tadi web openly. I&#39;ve been
    practising internally at
    <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/">Ink &amp; Switch</a>, and getting a
    load of good feedback.
  </p>
  <p>
    THEN I&#39;m presenting
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/explore/arroost/">Arroost</a> at
    <a href="https://liveprog.org/">LIVE</a> at
    <a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    THENNN I&#39;m presenting
    <a
      href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/natural-code/submitted/"
      >Dialogues on Natural Code</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of these require more prep than others. For example, the Natural Code
    one needs a bit more work.
  </p>
  <img src="3.jpg" alt="A messy network" />
  <h2 id="mess">Mess</h2>
  <p>
    Let&#39;s keep looking through the reviewer feedback for my
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/report/arroost/">Arroost essay</a>.
  </p>
  <p>Okay, Reviewer C summarises Arroost&#39;s focus on mess quite well:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      There are several ways that Arroost controls the user experience to
      encourage messy creation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        edges propagate activity according to a fixed beat, which cannot be
        changed
      </li>
      <li>
        meanwhile, node recordings may be of arbitrary length but still play in
        their entirety once activated, which leads unavoidably to messy overlaps
        between different node recordings
      </li>
      <li>
        the vertical positioning of a node changes the pitch of its recorded
        sound, which makes it sound silly and discourages the user from fiddling
        with spatial organization
      </li>
      <li>
        edges can be made to activate the target node one beat
        <em>before</em> the source node, which can be challenging to predict
        ahead of time as to how it affects the overall sound
      </li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And Reviewer A had a question about that:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      My first question was what this could mean for more
      &quot;traditional&quot; programming ‚Äîi.e., even the
      <a href="https://tldraw.substack.com/p/make-real-the-story-so-far"
        >MakeReal stuff</a
      >
      in <a href="https://tldraw.com">tldraw</a> ‚Äîwhat does this mean for coding
      web UIs or algorithms or spreadsheets? What does a messy spreadsheeting
      tool look like? Some additional focus on that, at/towards the end, could
      be beneficial.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I guess I could answer this question within the presentation.</p>
  <p>
    However, it isn&#39;t really the point of my essay. I&#39;m not interested
    in telling you &quot;how to be messy&quot;. I think it would be harmful to
    my message to claim that I&#39;ve &quot;figured it out&quot;, because my
    point is that we haven&#39;t spent enough time on this sort of thing. We
    haven&#39;t spent enough time trying to help people get past their emotional
    blockers. So <em>we don&#39;t know</em> how to use mess to overcome that. My
    answer to the question is:
  </p>
  <p>&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>
  <p><br /></p>

  </h1>
  <p>Welcome back to another weekly episode of the...</p>
  <p>üê∏ TODEPOND PONDCAST üê∏</p>
  <p>What&#39;s new this week?</p>
  <img src="4.png" alt="Heart of Clojure" />
  <h2 id="heart-of-clojure">Heart of clojure</h2>
  <p>
    I gave the
    <a href="https://2024.heartofclojure.eu/talks/what-it-means-to-be-open/"
      >opening keynote</a
    >
    at <a href="https://2024.heartofclojure.eu/">Heart of Clojure</a>!!!!!!!
  </p>
  <p>
    It was such a nice conference. It&#39;s the best conference I&#39;ve ever
    been to, by a long long long way. The community was fab, the organisation
    was impeccable, the talks and events and activities were all stellar. I saw
    lots of old friends and made many new ones, and Leuven was a beautiful
    backdrop.
  </p>
  <p>
    I&#39;m still recovering from the conference, both physically and
    emotionally, so I&#39;ll write it up properly at some point in the next
    couple of weeks. But yeah, the talk went really well I think. I learned a
    lot and I&#39;d do a lot different next time, as always, but I&#39;m pleased
    with how it went, and people kept coming up to me to talk about it for the
    following three days, which was really nice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thank you <a href="https://toot.cat/@plexus">Arne</a>! And thank you to the
    whole Heart of Clojure community!

  <img src="5.png" alt="Todepond Explorations" />
  <h2 id="explorations">Explorations</h2>
  <p>
    If you&#39;ve been following along these pondcasts for a while, you&#39;ll
    know that I&#39;ve been trying to figure out how to <em>frame</em> my work
    in a way that brings it some semblence of legitimacy. I started out just
    making silly
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLP4ZwudAKs">youtube videos</a>,
    but now I&#39;m doing more. It&#39;s art or research or something? Maybe? I
    don&#39;t know!
  </p>
  <p>What the hell am I doing? What do I tell people?</p>
  <p>Hmm..</p>
  <p>
    The &quot;video&quot; has always been the highest-level output of my work.
    Every other thing I do... the talks, the demos, the writing... it was all
    supposed to feed into the videos. But nowadays, that&#39;s not how it works
    for me.
  </p>
  <p>
    No. The videos are just one of many parts that feed into higher-level themes
    and projects. For example... figuring out
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQgxFuw8f1U">spatial programming</a
    >... figuring out
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/report/arroost/">scrappy fiddles</a>...
    figuring out the
    <a href="https://todepond.com/wikiblogarden/tadi-web/">tadi web</a>... I
    could call these &quot;projects&quot;, or I could call them something else,
    like <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/">tracks</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyway, I&#39;m calling them <strong>explorations</strong> and you can see
    them all at
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/explore">todepond.com/explore</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The biggest two so far are
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/explore/cellpond">Cellpond</a> and
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/explore/arroost">Arroost</a>. It&#39;s
    nice to collect together all the work I&#39;ve done on them so far.
  </p>
  <img src="6.png" alt="Untitled Collective" />
  <h2 id="collective">Collective</h2>
  <p>
    Speaking of legitimacy... Another thing I&#39;ve been thinking about for a
    while is how to brand my exploratory work.
  </p>
  <p>
    The &quot;Todepond&quot; brand is quite a silly one, and I like that. I
    don&#39;t want to make it more serious.
  </p>
  <p>
    So I was wondering about introducing a new umbrella organisation or name to
    encompass everything I do. This would let me start to build up a portfolio
    of slightly more serious work. I think this is important. Of course it&#39;s
    important!
  </p>
  <p>
    I briefly joked around about &quot;Todepond Industries&quot; or something,
    but that only sounded even more silly.
  </p>
  <p>
    As time went on, I started to realise that this slightly-more-serious
    identity shouldn&#39;t be Todepond-related at all. So it shouldn&#39;t be a
    &quot;Lu Wilson&quot; thing at all. Instead, it should be something I do
    with other people, like a group identity.
  </p>
  <p>
    So... I&#39;ve been speaking about this with a few close friends of mine for
    quite a while, and it looks like it&#39;s going to happen in some form.
    Originally we were thinking of naming the collective as a
    &quot;studio&quot;, but that could indicate that it&#39;s a studio that
    works together, or you can hire. So it&#39;s currently settles on being a
    &quot;collective&quot;.
  </p>
  <p>
    It&#39;ll be a collective of independent researchers/artists/explorers/etc
    who all share some values and high standards.
  </p>
  <p>Stay tuned for more!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
