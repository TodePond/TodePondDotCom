    TODEPOND PONDCAST: Past
  </h1>

  <p>Welcome back to another non-weekly episode of the...</p>
  <p>🐸 TODEPOND PONDCAST 🐸</p>
  <p>I&#39;m late again! I&#39;m very late, so it&#39;s a three-in-one.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>WARNING. This is a triple length pondcast.</strong></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    This time it&#39;s because I was away in Los Angeles! Keep reading for more
    details...
  </p>
  <p><img src="1.png" alt="image" /></p>
  <h2 id="live">LIVE</h2>
  <p>
    I was in Los Angeles for <a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a>, a
    big week-long academic conference about coding. It&#39;s a collection of
    many different workshops and other things that happen in the same place.
  </p>
  <p>
    First up, it was <a href="https://liveprog.org/">LIVE</a>, which is all
    about <em>live</em> coding. (The clue&#39;s in the name).
  </p>
  <p>
    At LIVE, I presented my live coding tool,
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/explore/arroost/">Arroost</a>, which you
    saw in the
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNBKdU6XrLY">Arrows</a> video
    already. In the presentation, I argue that we should pay more attention to
    supporting people&#39;s <strong>emotions</strong> within the tools that we
    make.
  </p>
  <p>
    The [presentation] was based on my earlier
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/report/arroost/">essay</a> about the same
    thing. I&#39;m proud of them both so I&#39;d be very grateful if you gave
    them a look!
  </p>
  <p>
    Watch the
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/4GOeYylCMJI?t=12475s"

    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/report/arroost/">essay here</a>.

  <h2 id="onward-">Onward!</h2>
  <p>
    Two days later, I presented at
    <a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/track/splash-2024-Onward-Essays"
      >Onward</a
    >. It was about the
    <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3689492.3689807">essay</a> I wrote
    with <a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu/~ackley/">Dave Ackley</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Onward is a <em>real</em> academic setting for new and radical ideas about
    coding. They have PDFs and hidden costs and everything. It was crazy to be
    standing among some industry legends like
    <a href="https://www.felienne.com/">Felienne Hermans</a> and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Shaw_(computer_scientist"
      >Mary Shaw</a
    >, two people I really look up to. I tried to keep my cool around them, and
    I think I only moderately embarrassed myself.
  </p>
  <p>
    It&#39;s also crazy to have a PDF to my name: A real citable academic paper—
    I mean— essay, with an index number thingy and everything. I think it&#39;s
    called a &quot;DOI&quot; but I have no idea what it stands for and I
    don&#39;t care to find out.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyway, yes, our essay— I mean— our paper is about &quot;natural code&quot;,
    the idea that all communication can be meaningfully viewed as code, that can
    be transmitted and implemented and run, like code. It&#39;s natural code.
  </p>
  <p>
    To arrive at that idea, the essay goes through some slightly trippy
    realisations, and it was nice to be able to perform those notes in person.
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, I&#39;d be very grateful if you gave our
    <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3689492.3689807"
      >essay a read</a
    >
    and/or
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV12HhAYIik">the talk a watch</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The conclusion of SPLASH marked the
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/talk/season/over/"
      >end of todepond talk season</a
    >. We celebrated by going to
    <a href="https://elk.zone/mas.to/@TodePond/113403124120944196">disneyland</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p><img src="3.png" alt="image" /></p>
  <h2 id="iclc">ICLC</h2>
  <p>
    Just before SPLASH, I submitted a workshop to
    <a href="https://iclc.toplap.org/2025/">ICLC</a>.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>What is it with academic events and long capital letter acronyms?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    I have no idea what ICLC stands for but I&#39;m pretty sure that &quot;Live
    Programming&quot; is in there somewhere. Anyway, I put in an application to
    run a workshop about
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/explore/cellpond/">cellpond</a> and I have
    no idea if I&#39;ll be accepted or not.
  </p>
  <p>
    The idea behind the workshop is that cellpond is &quot;live&quot; coding in
    the sense that the computation running inside cellpond can be a living
    system. It can be &quot;alive&quot;. Or at least, somewhere along the
    spectrum of aliveness. It&#39;s not at zero. And this is made easier by a
    couple of things:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cellpond is very non-deterministic.</li>
    <li>Cellpond programs are (usually) spatial.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you watched my
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV12HhAYIik"
      >talk on natural code</a
    >, you might notice some links here. And that&#39;s because this workshop
    follows on from that most directly. I hope to elaborate more in the future!
  </p>
  <p>
    If I get rejected, maybe I can find another chance to give the workshop.
    We&#39;ll see!
  </p>

  <h1 id="todepond-pondcast-present">TODEPOND PONDCAST: Present</h1>
  <p>And now onto part two...</p>
  <p><img src="4.png" alt="flok" /></p>
  <h2 id="pasta-gang">Pasta gang</h2>
  <p>
    If you watched either of my
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/hlsDbXSZ2ko">two</a>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/LrTiAm0wHOU">livestreams</a>, you may
    have seen me using <a href="https://strudel.cc/">strudel</a> to make some
    live music. Yes, <a href="https://strudel.cc/">strudel</a> is a live
    programming tool that you can use in any web browser to make music
    on-the-spot (live). And I&#39;ve been learning how to use it, following on
    from my
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/explore/arroost/">arroost work</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The thing is, it&#39;s way more fun to do strudel with other people: an
    audience and also live collaborators (both, simultaneously).
  </p>
  <p>
    So strudel&#39;s creator,
    <a href="https://loophole-letters.vercel.app/">Felix Roos</a>, suggested to
    me that I could try out <a href="https://flok.cc/">flok</a>, another tool,
    this one by
    <a href="https://elk.zone/mas.to/@munshkr@toplap.org">Damián Silvani</a>.
    Yes, <a href="https://flok.cc">flok</a> is a live collaboration tool for
    various different live programming tools, including strudel. It splits the
    screen up into different parts, with each part being a different tool. It
    means that multiple people can make music (or visuals) together, at the same
    time.
  </p>
  <p>
    So I started doing all of my music-making in a single flok room, which means
    that anyone else can join, at any time, and it has really been quite
    special. To make music with random strangers on the internet has been—
    I&#39;m not exaggerating to say that it has sometimes felt like a religious
    experience. I&#39;ll write more on it another time but—
  </p>
  <p>
    The problem with this approach is that— by using this flok room, random
    strangers can run code on your computer, which can be abused. It&#39;s
    probably not okay to rely on trust here, so I created a
    <a href="https://todepond.cool/flok">new website</a> to host a safe little
    sandboxed version on. I barely did anything at all, but it&#39;s nice to be
    able to use it without worrying about people messing around with my
    computer, by popping open dialogs, or opening tabs, or whatever, unless I
    messed something up.
  </p>
  <p>
    I haven&#39;t been sharing around the link much, but you can find it at
    <a href="https://todepond.cool/flok">todepond.cool/flok</a>. Leave me (or
    others) a message there!

  <h2 id="strudel-for-beginners-and-experts">
    Strudel for beginners and experts
  </h2>
  <p>
    I also attended the
    <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/">Ink &amp; Switch</a>
    <a href="https://lu.ma/2024-unconf-losangeles">event</a> at SPLASH. It was
    an &quot;unconference&quot;, which means that anyone can put forward
    activities for people to do.
  </p>
  <p>
    I put forward an activity called &quot;strudel for beginners and
    experts&quot;. My hope was that some beginners (like myself) would attend,
    and some experts would also show up to help teach us all. Luckily, it
    happened, and strudel expert
    <a href="https://ijc8.me/">Ian Clestor</a> helped a bunch of people get
    started, even pulling out his slides from a strudel workshop he ran at a
    previous thing.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://loophole-letters.vercel.app/">Felix Roos</a>, creator of
    strudel, also showed up!!!!! He showed up remotely, of course, in my
    safe-ish flok room. It was fun making music in strudel with him and also
    some other people who had never used it before. I enjoyed seeing the look on
    <a href="https://joshmpollock.com/">Josh Pollock</a>&#39;s
    <a href="https://elk.zone/mas.to/@TodePond/113376237989502470">face</a>
    after a long session with Felix. It&#39;s nice to share a
    <a href="https://joshmpollock.com/blog/alive/">glimpse</a> of the
    &quot;religious experience&quot; thing I was talking about earlier.
    Anyway...
  </p>
  <p><img src="6.png" alt="image" /></p>
  <h2 id="institute-of-weirdcoding">Institute of weirdcoding</h2>
  <p>
    I put forward another activity with
    <a href="https://ivanish.ca">Ivan Reese</a>. It was a sequel to our session
    from last year,
    <a href="https://elk.zone/mas.to/@TodePond/111127996056302508"
      >stop computerprogramming</a
    >.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Both of these sessions were put on by our fictional &quot;Institute of
      weirdcoding&quot; organisation, as part of some extremely slowly advancing
      lore.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    This year&#39;s session was called &quot;NO MORE IDEAS&quot;, which follows
    on from my
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft6xOAijwFo">tadi web talk</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the session, we all mapped out all of the different movements for
    &quot;better computing&quot;, like
    <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/">local-first</a>,
    <a href="https://permacomputing.net/permacomputing/">permacomputing</a>,
    <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>,
    <a href="https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/">small web</a>,
    <a href="https://dubroy.com/blog/cold-blooded-software/"
      >cold-blooded software</a
    >, and so on. The list is very long.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second thing we did was to eliminate any incompatible movements, while
    trying to keep as many as possible. For example,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">Web3</a> is incompatible with
    the
    <a href="https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/"
      >sustainable web manifesto</a
    >, so we got rid of it. (Web3, not the sustainable web). (We got rid of
    Web3).
  </p>
  <p>
    The third task was to identify the running themes within these different
    movements. We tried to identify what these movements were
    <em>getting at</em>, beyond just their names and norms.
  </p>
  <p>
    And then we tried to chart out these themes. Were any related? Was it a
    spectrum? How many dimensions were there?
  </p>
  <p>
    In the end, we realised that the themes ended up landing in one of three
    groups. One was about staying simple and small. One was about being
    connected. And one was about being able to last a long time.
  </p>
  <p>
    And there was this epiphany moment, where it became apparent what these
    three groups were:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Caring about the past: Staying where we came from: Small and simple.
    </li>
    <li>
      Caring about the present: Being connected to others: Being present in
      community.
    </li>
    <li>
      Caring about the future: Lasting a long time: Being sustainable and
      maintainable.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The thing bridging all of these movements together was &quot;time&quot;!
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <p>
    It was a silly activity really. It was quite funny to carry out such a
    seemingly pointless task. But it did cause a lot of good discussion, and
    some people shared their useful insights with me. More on that another time.
  </p>

  <p>Right, we&#39;re getting there... This is part three.</p>
  <p><img src="7.png" alt="image" /></p>
  <h2 id="placements">Placements</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://slab.org/">Alex McLean</a> asked me if he could put me down
    as a visiting researcher, which could mean &quot;doing something patterny
    for a week or so&quot;. It would happen &quot;quite far in the future&quot;
    and we &quot;would sort the details out nearer the time&quot;.

    So of course I said yes, without asking any follow up questions because for
    me it&#39;s a no-brainer.
  </p>
  <p>
    This all depends on Alex securing funding, of course, which I expect to
    happen.
  </p>
  <p><br /></p>
  <p>
    I&#39;m still a
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/research/er-in-residence/"
      >researcher-in-residence</a
    >
    at <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/">Ink &amp; Switch</a>, and have
    been for a while now. It&#39;s been very helpful to my learning and
    practice.
  </p>
  <p>
    And I wonder how long I&#39;m allowed to stay in that role, or how long I
    should stay. If it lasts forever, it&#39;s not really a
    &quot;residency&quot;, is it?

  <p>
    Sometimes people ask me what my work is &quot;about&quot;, and I&#39;ve
    never been able to give them a good answer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Part of the reason for that is because of how I tend to work in a
    &quot;bottom-up&quot; way. I don&#39;t start with a goal, or a use-case. I
    start by exploring &#39;primitives&#39;, the lego pieces that I put together
    to <em>do stuff</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I suppose I&#39;ve always followed my nose, with making videos, and
    eventually accidentally reaching people, and entering research and art
    worlds.
  </p>
  <p>
    Still, it&#39;s helpful to be able to give people something to hold onto, so
    that they can put my work in a box in their head. So I&#39;ve been playing
    around with the term &quot;empathetic computing&quot; and I&#39;m not sure
    about it yet. It sounds a bit too pompous, I think. But we&#39;ll see.

  <h2 id="total-todepond">Total todepond</h2>
  <p>
    Of course, I really am working towards &quot;total todepond&quot;, which
    means working on all this todepond work full-time.
  </p>
  <p>
    It&#39;s really hard keeping this all up at the same time as doing a
    full-time job, but I&#39;ve nearly always done that. The only time I
    didn&#39;t was over nine months a couple of years ago. That period of time
    led to
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMJ1H3Ai-qs"
      >New Cellular Automata</a
    >
    and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4OIcwt8vcE">Screens</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I&#39;m in no rush to leave my (wonderful) job, but I am thinking that my
    eventual next job will hopefully be total todepond. My work <em>now</em> is
    to prepare for that. So of course...
