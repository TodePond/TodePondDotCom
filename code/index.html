<h1>Dialogues on natural code</h1>

<p>
  I wrote a paper! I wrote a paper with my friend and mentor,
  <a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu/~ackley/">Dave Ackley</a>.
</p>

<p>
  We
  <a
    href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/natural-code/submitted/">
    submitted</a
  >
  it quite a long time ago now, and I'm delighted to say... that after two
  rounds of reviews, plenty of edits, hours and hours of conversation, several
  battles with latex, thousands of dollars, one cover letter, one all-nighter,
  and one trip to Los Angeles...
</p>

<p>
  We have now
  <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3689492.3689807">published</a>!!!!!!

<h2>Thank you</h2>

<p>First of all, some thanks are in order.</p>

<p>
  Of course, I'd like to thank
  <a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu/~ackley/">Dave Ackley</a>, my friend and
  mentor, for his help and guidance and <code>big fun</code> every step of the
  way.

<p>
  And thank you to everyone who's ever contributed to the
  <a href="https://www.livingcomputation.org/">Living Computation Foundation</a
  >. You helped to fund this paper!
</p>

<br />

<p>
  Thank you to
  <a href="https://www.subtext-lang.org/AboutMe.htm">Jonathan Edwards</a> for
  encouraging us to write a paper with his
  <a href="https://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=1708">blog post</a>, despite it
  being a blog post, and despite my
  <a href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/from/the-outside/"
    >facetious response</a
  >.

  <a href="https://www.taeumel.eu/">Marcel Taeumel</a> for running the
  <a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/track/splash-2024-Onward-Essays"

<p>
  Thank you to our reviewers! Especially reviewer C, who was the most critical.
  They made our paper much better.
</p>

<p>
  And thank you to our shepherd,
  <a href="https://wirfs-brock.com/allen/about">Allen Wirfs-Brock</a>, for all
  his help in getting our paper over the line. Thank you also to
  <a href="https://wirfs-brock.com/rebecca/">Rebecca Wirfs-Brock</a>, who
  sherpherded our shepherd.

<p>It keeps going!</p>

<p>
  Thank you to everyone who read early drafts of our paper and gave feedback.
  This includes <a href="https://murilopolese.com/">Murilo Polese</a>,
  <a href="https://www.geoffreylitt.com/">Geoffrey Litt</a> and
  <a href="https://ivanish.ca/">Ivan Reese</a>.

<p>
  And finally... Thank you to
  <a href="https://floracaulton.com/">Flora Caulton</a>, for all her help and
  support with my stupid stupid work.
</p>

<p>
  Luckily, there was an
  <a href="https://lightboxexpo.com/">animation conference</a> going on in Los
  Angeles at the same time, so we were able to go together!

<br />

<h2>No thank you</h2>

<p>And now... some of the things that weren't so nice.</p>

<p>
  The first "no thank you" goes to the ACM for charging me stupidly large
  amounts of money to attend my own talks.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="ticket.png" alt="Prices for tickets" />
  <figcaption>Paying to listen to myself.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  The second "no thank you" also goes to the ACM for charging us one thousand
  dollars to make our paper freely available.
</p>

<p>We decided to not pay this.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="open.png" alt="Open access charge" />
  <figcaption>Unpaid open access charge.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  The third "no thank you" goes to the awful PDF format, and the disgustingly
  bad latex tools we were forced to use by the ACM.
</p>

<p>
  It was so bad (so so bad) that it inspired me to write not one, but two poems
  about how bad PDFs are.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/pdfs/"
      >PDFs are so bad</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/pdfs/2/"
      >PDFs are so bad 2</a
    >
  </li>
</ul>

<br />

<p>
  And the final "no thank you" goes to the misogynistic question that was asked
  to the speaker before me.
</p>

<p>
  If you missed that one, I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend you check out
  <a href="https://www.felienne.com/">Felienne Hermans</a>'s
  <a href="https://www.felienne.com/archives/8470">paper</a> and
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/-Br66SUjsdQ?si=3PKMpXa1-J1qvjD5&t=12129"
    >talk</a
  >. It was inspirational.
</p>

<br />

<h2>The paper</h2>

<p>
  Like I mentioned earlier, we didn't pay for "open access", so you can't freely
  access our paper from the
  <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3689492.3689807">ACM library</a>.
</p>

<p>
  However, they do allow us to share a pre-print on our personal websites. So
  here we are!
</p>

<br />

<p>
  In the spirit of
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJzV0CX0q8o">open practice</a>, and
  as an act of minor rebellion against the ACM's gatekeeping, I've decided to
  share a very specific early version of our paper.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  <strong>
    Click <a class="warning" href="/code/dialogue.pdf">here</a> to download the
    re-submitted version of our paper. It includes:
  </strong>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Red line numbers.</li>
  <li>Sentence casing in titles, which goes against ACM rules.</li>
  <li>Lots of XXXXXXXXXXX placeholders.</li>
  <li>Some incorrect dates.</li>
  <li>
    The cover letter I wrote at the middle of the night, containing our
    reactions and responses to reviewer feedback.
  </li>
  <li>Unbalanced columns on the final page.</li>
  <li>Overflowing text.</li>
  <li>
    A full diff of our initial submission compared to our resubmission. This
    required a lot of battling against latex, and is perhaps one of the proudest
    yet most pointless victories of my entire life, so I am pleased to include
    it here.
  </li>
</ul>

<br />

<br />

<p>
  I hope you enjoy reading our paper. And I hope this becomes the 'canonical'
  version of it.
</p>

<br />

<h2>The talk</h2>

<p>I also gave a talk about our paper at SPLASH 2024.</p>

<p>Here it is! I edited the audio a bit to make it more legible.</p>
<style>
  .video-container {
    position: relative;
    padding-bottom: 56.25%;
    padding-top: 0px;
    height: 0;
    overflow: hidden;
  }

  .video-container iframe,
  .video-container object,
  .video-container embed {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
  }
</style>
<div class="video-container">
  <iframe
    width="100%"

    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<br />
<br />

<h2>Dialogues</h2>

<p>
  Our paper is a paper about <strong>communication</strong> and
  <strong>code</strong>, and how the two relate, or how they do not. So I hope
  you will consider <strong>communicating</strong> your thoughts with me: Do you
  like our paper? Do you hate it? And more importantly: Why?
</p>

<br />
<br />

<p>
  <em>
    If you do decide to communicate with me, please don't be like the ACM. Don't
    do it privately. Contact me in the
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJzV0CX0q8o">open</a>. Transmit
    your message for all to see!
  </em>
</p>

<br />

<p>So hit either of us up on mastodon, or on bluesky if you really insist.</p>
