# Blending does not erase (binned)

One of the most common criticisms of the tadi web is—

<br>

<br>

The [tadi web](/explore/tadi-web) is the idea that there are lots of different movements out there that try to "make computing better", like [local-first] and [IndieWeb] and [permacomputing] and [many more]. I call these "better computing" movements or [better computings].

And the tadi web says that we should bring these movements together so that they can work together / so that we can figure out how to do them all at the same time. I call this "blending". I think we should blend together the communities that form these movements, so that they all become stronger.

Some people tell me that blending communities is bad because it erases those communities that you blend. By blending them all into one, they lose their identity / whatever it is that makes them unique.

Before I respond, I'd say that the people who tell me this tend to be—

I can only imagine that they don't live in a— haven't been exposed to / haven't experienced a [multicultural environment] before, or— Not in any depth, at least. 

Because, if they had, they would know that bringing communities together does not dampen them, but makes us all richer and more present.

I mean, this is not an advanced idea: This is pluralism 101.

There is no point for a movement to exist in a vacuum. It can only do something by being connected to other parts of work and culture. Otherwise, there is no point, and—

Besides, half of these better computings are all about connectedness. Local-first has multiplayer collaboration built into its definition. IndieWeb is all about staying in touch. And permacomputing is about maintaining continuity into the future.

THE WHOLE POINT is to make connections and make it all happen for real: Not to only exist in hypothetical intellectual meetings or internet arguments.

## Blending the edges

To blend two splodges of colour together, you only need to smudge the edges. You don't need to mix them in their entirety: You don't need to average them out all over. You don't need to eradicate the old. They don't need to become one. They can still exist on their own, but now there's a clear gradient / ramp / bridge / connection between them too.

The same is true for communities. Blending them together means **connecting** them. It doesn't mean **erasing** them. But some people can't kick the conquering mindset, and they can only see it this way.

Ah screw it I'm going round in circles, I will let this post die.
