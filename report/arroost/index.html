<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Live programming</strong> is uniquely suited to
  <strong>creative work</strong>. It can remove many of the creative
  <strong>blockers</strong> that individuals experience when trying to produce
  it. But we could place much more explicit emphasis on the removal of
  <strong>emotional blockers</strong> from the creative process, as opposed to
  only focusing on <strong>intellectual blockers</strong>. Arroost is a project
  that seeks to do that — an experimental live programming tool for making
  music.

<h2>Creative work</h2>

<p>
  For me, <strong>creative work</strong> is when you use your imagination to
  "make something". This could be performing a song, writing a book, painting a
  picture, drawing a diagram, baking a cake, giving a speech, designing a game,
  or coding a program.
</p>

<!-- <p>
  For ease and simplicity, this essay will focus only on
  <strong>making pictures</strong> and <strong>making music</strong>.
</p> -->

<!-- <p>
  Some people might disagree with me. They might say that "coding a program"
  isn't <strong>creative work</strong>, or one of my other examples isn't
  <strong>creative work</strong>. They might say that I'm being too loose with
  my definition, and that's okay. We don't need to agree on that for the
  purposes of this essay. I'm going to stick to examples that are about
  <strong>making pictures</strong> and <strong>making music</strong> because
  they're easy to talk about.
</p>

<p>
  But if you <em>do</em> agree with me on those other examples being creative
  work, then you can imagine that I'm talking about any of them, any time I say
  <strong>creative work</strong>.
</p> -->

<h2>Blockers</h2>

<p>
  In any creative work, the person doing the work might experience
  <strong>blockers</strong> that stop them from continuing. Let's think about
  what those blockers could be. Here are some examples of potential blockers.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>"Oh no! I ran out of paint."</li>
  <li>"I don't know how to use this programming language."</li>
  <li>"I feel too nervous to go up on stage."</li>
  <li>"I can't visualise what I want to make."</li>
  <li>"I suck at drawing. It'll look stupid if I try."</li>
  <li>"There's too much pressure on me to be good."</li>
  <li>"It's not producing the thing I want and I don't know why."</li>
  <li>"I've ran out of ideas."</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure you could think of some more examples of your own.</p>

<h2>Emotional versus intellectual</h2>

<p>
  We could categorise all of these potential <strong>blockers</strong> into one
  of two categories:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Intellectual blockers</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Emotional blockers</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>Intellectual blockers</strong> are when you don't know how to solve a
  problem, or create what you intend, even if you know what you want. You might
  not know how to use a tool, or you may not have the right materials. Your tool
  might be insufficient! Your paint bucket was too small, or your coding tool
  was too limited. Or your programming environment doesn't give you enough
  realtime feedback, so you have no chance of understanding how it works.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Emotional blockers</strong> are when you have the tools and materials
  and skills that you need, but you're feeling too nervous, or too scared, or
  too embarrassed, or too distracted.
</p>

<p>Let's organise our example blockers into a table.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Intellectual blockers</th>
      <th>Emotional blockers</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        "Oh no! I ran out of paint."<br />
        "I don't know how to use this programming language."<br />
        "I can't visualise what I want to make."<br />
        "It's not producing the thing I want and I don't know why."
      </td>
      <td>
        "I feel too nervous to go up on stage."<br />
        "I suck at drawing. It'll look stupid if I try."<br />
        "There's too much pressure on me to be good."<br />
        "I've ran out of ideas."
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Live programming</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Live programming</strong> has often been paired with
  <strong>creative work</strong>, the current canonical examples being
  <a href="https://worrydream.com/">Bret Victor</a>'s
  <a href="https://vimeo.com/906418692">Inventing On Principle</a> and
  <a href="https://vimeo.com/64895205">Dead Fish</a> talks.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="principle.png" />
  <figcaption>Getting immediate feedback in Inventing On Principle.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  And <a>Ink & Switch</a> continues work in that vein, with
  <strong>live programming</strong> projects like
  <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/untangle/">Untangle</a> being used to
  explore different possibilities for generative art in a playground-like
  setting.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="untangle.jpeg" />
  <figcaption>Exploring generative art in Untangle.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  It goes without saying that
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QY2x6aZzqc">live coding itself</a>
  combines <strong>live programming</strong> with
  <strong>creative work</strong>. And
  <a href="https://slab.org/">Alex McLean</a>'s
  <a href="https://algorave.com/">Algorave</a> continues to foster an
  international community of live coders, using tools like
  <a href="https://strudel.cc/">Strudel</a>.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="strudel.png" />
  <figcaption>You can see what's firing in Strudel.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  I can guess why the two have been paired up — they're a great fit for each
  other. <strong>Live programming</strong>'s immediate feedback encourages
  exploration and play. This allows the coder to discover new possibilities, and
  to <em>feel</em> their way through the tool. And the emphasis on tangible
  representation of code allows the coder to directly manipulate their work, and
  visualise what is going on. They can <em>see it</em>.
</p>

<p>
  From these benefits, I can see how <strong>live programming</strong> removes
  many creative <strong>blockers</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Tools for thought</h2>

<p>
  Personally, I feel that there has been a lot of attention on removing
  <strong>intellectual blockers</strong>, and there is still far more to explore
  in terms of removing <strong>emotional blockers</strong>. I think there is a
  lot of untapped potential there (which I will now try to convince you of over
  the course of this essay).
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    We work alongside/within the <strong>tools for thought</strong> space, where
    interest is around supporting a person's thoughts, enabling them to use the
    computer as an extension of their brain. And this ties into the ever-cited
    <strong>bicycle of the mind</strong> metaphor. The computer is a tool that
    magnifies our intellectual capabilities, just as a bicycle magnifies our
    physical capabilities.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my opinion, these metaphors reveal a bias towards tools that remove
    <strong>intellectual blockers</strong>. They acknowledge that our brain has
    limits, and they seek to support it.
  </p>

  <p>
    If that is true, we could also conceive of a set of tools that help us to
    overcome <strong>emotional blockers</strong>. We should acknowledge that our
    emotions have limits, and we can use computers to help support them. Perhaps
    we could call it... <strong>tools for feeling</strong>... no that's too
    cheesy... how about... <strong>bicycle for the heart</strong>... no I don't
    like that either. Let's move on.
  </p>

</h1>

<p>
  It turns out, there <em>are</em> many tools out there that try to remove
  <strong>emotional blockers</strong>. We can learn from them when making our
  <strong>live programming</strong> tools.
</p>

<h2>tldraw</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://tldraw.com">tldraw</a> is a whiteboard tool and library. It's
  interesting because it's all very wobbly. Whenever you draw, or write, or make
  shapes, all of your marks are imperfect. Everything looks slightly wonky and
  scrappy.
</p>

<p>
  This wonkiness is intentional. tldraw makes it difficult to line up your work
  perfectly. It's so hard that it stops you trying, and you carry on drawing and
  writing instead.
</p>

<p>
  And tldraw presents you with a very limited number of colours to pick from,
  twelve in total. You don't waste time obsessing over finding the perfect
  colour because you can't. You just pick one and draw.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="tldraw.png" />
  <figcaption>
    It's hard to line up your shapes in tldraw, so you stop trying.

<h2>Sandspiel</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://sandspiel.club">Sandspiel</a> is a video game that simulates
  different elements on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Elements like sand, water, fire
  all behave differently and interact together in combinatorial ways. This kind
  of game is known as a
  <a href="https://maxbittker.com/making-sandspiel/">falling sand game</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The unusual thing about Sandspiel is that most users don't use it as a falling
  sand game. They use it as a drawing tool instead.
  <em>Why would they do that?</em>
</p>

<p>
  Why would anyone <em>draw</em> in a <strong>falling sand game</strong> and not
  an actual drawing tool like Photoshop or Procreate or Pixlr, or even Microsoft
  Paint, or even just on a physical piece of paper? Sandspiel wasn't
  (originally) designed for drawing, so it seems like an odd choice.
</p>
<p>
  But the occasional commenter explains why: They've already tried those "real"
  drawing tools, and it goes badly. They can't handle the pressure of the blank
  canvas, and the expectation to make something good. But in Sandspiel, they
  feel free to draw to their heart's content. And they feel free to share their
  work with the world.
</p>
<p>
  And with Sandspiel, there's some warmup time. When you enter Sandspiel, you
  have something to play with. You can place down elements, and interact with
  the game while you're deciding what to draw. You might get inspiration from
  the game itself.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="sandspiel.png" />
  <figcaption>
    Sandspiel isn't a drawing tool but people use it as one.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  <a href="https://studio.sandspiel.club">Sandspiel Studio</a> is a
  <strong>live programming</strong> tool that I worked on with
  <a href="https://maxbittker.com/">Max Bittker</a>, the creator of Sandspiel.
  It's an end-user-programmable version of Sandspiel. Users can use its
  block-based code editor to change how the elements behave and look.
</p>
<p>
  We tried to lean into the same strengths that Sandspiel has. It doesn't start
  you off with a blank canvas. You start with a palette of existing elements,
  and you can begin by editing them, and playing around. You're not forced to
  start from scratch (like in <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>),
  which is much more daunting. The goal of this is to stop the users feeling
  afraid. The goal is to remove <strong>emotional blockers</strong>. They can
  take their time to get familiar with the system, before jumping in.
</p>

<h2>Algorave</h2>

<p>
  <a href="Algorave">Algorave</a> is a practice where someone
  <strong>live codes</strong> visuals and music, and a crowd dances to it, in
  response.
</p>

<p>
  This puts the <strong>live coder</strong> in a vulnerable position because
  there is a certain amount of pressure involved. If they make a mistake, it
  could affect the whole crowd.
</p>

<p>
  However, the fact that it's being done <strong>live</strong> as a performance
  means that the expectations are adjusted. People can meaningfully expect that
  there <em>will</em> be some mistakes, and that's actually part of the fun.
  There is a culture of
  <a
    href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/scrappy-fiddles/sharing/normalising/live/"
    >embracing the mistake</a
  >
  within <strong>live coding</strong> and Algorave, and that removes
  <strong>emotional blockers</strong> around failure.

<h2>Toshio Iwai</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/t8cI6GlyKqk?si=mxfCmWDIN10ginxP">
    Toshio Iwai</a
  >
  is an artist who has developed various <strong>live programming</strong> tools
  for making music. These include
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Fantasy">Sound Fantasy</a> and
  the more widely known
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28UDxIQiaIY">Electroplankton</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Both tools provide the user with puzzle-like musical instruments. But using
  them feels less like playing an instrument, and more like playing a game —
  interacting with an environment. As the music-maker, it feels like you take a
  secondary role to the tool itself. You cannot control it in its entirety, you
  can only influence it to an extent, to try to get the simulation to make
  different kinds of sounds. It is the tool making those sounds, not you, and
  this takes some responsibility away from you. There is no pressure on the
  user. There are no <strong>emotional blockers</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Maywa Denki</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKPBD3HHU4g">Maywa Denki</a> is an
  art collective disguised as an electric company. They produce musical
  instruments known as
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX-dEq4UDYI">nonsense machines</a>,
  some of which are <strong>programmable</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  These nonsense machines are interesting because, despite being toy
  instruments, they are not designed to be easy to use. Instruments like the
  Otamatone are intentionally hard, and can sound terrible in the hands of a
  beginner, even grating. The effect of this is that there is no pressure on the
  user to perform or create something good. The expectation is that it will
  sound bad, so there are no <strong>emotional blockers</strong>.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="otomatone.png" />
  <figcaption>The Otamatone is intentionally hard to play.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Friends</h2>

<p>
  Is it possible to try to combine the strengths of these tools into a single
  <strong>live programming</strong> environment? What would that look like —
  sound like? Would it be good? Would it be terrible?
</p>

<p>
  To try this out, I made a <strong>live programming</strong> tool called
  <a href="https://arroost.com">Arroost</a>. It's pretty buggy.
</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<h1 id="part-two">
  <a class="anchor" href="#part-two">Part two: ARROOST</a>
</h1>

<p>When you first open Arroost, you're presented with a message.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="intro.png" />
  <figcaption>The first thing you see when you open Arroost.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  When you click, a single shape slides onto screen. As an introduction, this
  first moment is important. It shouldn't feel like you 'created' this shape. It
  should feel like a surprise. And it shouldn't slide to where your cursor is —
  that would be too helpful.
</p>

<p>This should tell you that you're not in control. Arroost is in charge.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="shape.png" />
  <figcaption>This slides on when you click the screen.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Play</h2>

<p>
  At this point, you are able to drag the shape and the world around. It's a
  chance to get a feel for the physics of the tool. Every object, including the
  camera, has inertia. They should feel like physical objects. It should feel
  like a simulation.
</p>

<p>The user can click on the shape to pull out a line.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="line.png" />
  <figcaption>A line.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>By clicking again on the canvas, it creates another shape.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="two-shapes.png" />
  <figcaption>A new shape.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  This second shape is a Recording shape. Click it to start recording, and click
  again to stop.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="recording.png" />
  <figcaption>Recording.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  After recording a sound, you can click the shape to play it back. And the
  noise can be adjusted by moving around the shape. If you drag it higher, the
  sound gets higher pitch. If you drag it lower, it gets lower pitch.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="sound.png" />
  <figcaption>You can edit the pitch of a sound.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  You can also adjust the horizontal line on the shape to change the starting
  offset of the sound.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="offset.png" />
  <figcaption>You can change the starting offset of a sound.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  You can feasibly spend a lot of time just playing with the shapes and sounds.
  I would like to point out that this all happens <em>before</em> you start
  doing any <strong>live programming</strong>. I think that it is important to
  let the user <strong>play</strong> with a creative tool before they start
  creating anything substantial. This is similar to what was seen in Sandspiel
  and Sandspiel Studio, and it's a philosophy that I followed with
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQgxFuw8f1U">CellPond</a> too, one of
  my previous projects. In CellPond, you can spend a lot of time
  <em>just drawing</em> before getting started with any
  <strong>live programming</strong>. It gets you used to the system.
</p>

<p>
  By letting the user play, you remove the pressure and stress of the blank
  canvas. At some point, they might hear back a certain sound that inspires them
  to <strong>live program</strong> a song.
</p>

<h2>Mess</h2>

<p>
  Recording sounds yourself (eg: with your voice) can be intimidating for some
  people. This makes it a good candidate as a use case for exploring how to
  remove <strong> emotional blockers</strong>. One way this is overcome is
  through <strong>mess</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  By dragging the Recording shape up and down, the sound changes pitch, and
  sounds distorted. It intentionally sounds very <em>silly</em>, which can serve
  as an "ice-breaker" for a timid user. It uses comedy to relax them, before
  they begin to take the tool seriously.
</p>

<p>
  After creating a few recordings, the user is presented with another shape. The
  Connection shape.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="connection.png" />
  <figcaption>The Connection shape.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Connection shape allows you to connect two shapes together.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click the Connection shape.</li>
  <li>Click the first shape.</li>
  <li>Click the second shape.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Now, when the first shape is clicked, it will trigger the second shape at the
  same time. I call this <strong>firing</strong>. When you click a shape, you
  <strong>fire</strong> it.
</p>

<p>
  By connecting two sounds together with <strong>wires</strong>, you can start
  to create more complex noises.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="connected.png" />
  <figcaption>Two shapes connected.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  You can click the triangle button on a wire to change the
  <strong>timing</strong> of a wire. Click it once to change the timing from "on
  the same beat" to "one beat later".
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="timing.png" />
  <figcaption>You can change the timing of a wire.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  This lets you create a chain of sounds to make sequences and loops. This lets
  you start to make songs.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="sequence.png" />
  <figcaption>Sequences and loops.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  Notably, it's really hard to time your different sounds perfectly together
  using this approach to timing. The timing of your recordings and sounds can
  get very sloppy and arrhythmic. This is intentional. The user should not spend
  too much time on getting their sequences to line up well. They should be
  encouraged to continue recording and arranging their sounds in a way that
  encourages <strong>creation</strong>, not perfection.
</p>

<p>
  The user <em>can</em> adjust the precise timing of sounds by dragging a
  sounds's horizontal line left and right, but they aren't given much visual
  feedback on this — just a low fidelity horizontal line. It's something they
  have to "feel out". They can't obsess on lining up sound waves with each
  other, like you can in most audio editing software. This is something that I
  have been <strong>emotionally blocked</strong> by in the past.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="sound-waves.png" />
  <figcaption>You can see sound waves in Davinci Resolve.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  There is also no capacity to edit the sound itself. There is no noise
  reduction, and no effects available. There is no decision paralysis around
  this. Like in tldraw, you are given a limited set of tools to work with, and
  everything you make is slightly imperfect. This
  <strong>emotionally unblocks</strong>
  you from obsessing over details.
</p>

<p>
  This is something that community member
  <a href="https://edibotopic.com/">Shane Crowley</a> experienced and wrote
  about in his
  <a href="https://edibotopic.com/blog/doing/leisure-sick/">blog post</a>. He
  stated:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <em
      >"One of the factors that makes recording vocals difficult is the need for
      noise-reduction. Usually this requires recording some ambient noise and
      subtracting it from the recording. This needs continuous tweaking and can
      result in poor quality audio if you're not in a good recording environment
      (I rarely am). With Arroost I couldn't do noise reduction, so I stopped
      caring and just focused on recording. </em
    >"
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  When I first added the pitch-shifting feature to Arroost, I received some
  negative feedback from users. They said it was annoying that they couldn't
  move around their sounds without it also changing the pitch. Sometimes, they
  liked to arrange their canvas in a certain way, and keep it clean and neat,
  and now they couldn't do that.
</p>
<p>
  This was great to hear, because it meant that the pitch-shifting feature was
  stopping people from obsessing over the cleanliness of their canvas. It was
  making <strong>mess</strong> the default state of the tool, which takes the
  pressure off.
</p>
<p>
  If a user does want to move a sound, they face a difficult choice. Do they
  really need to move it, and risk ruining its pitch? Or can they leave it be,
  and carry on <strong>creating</strong>?
</p>

<h2>Responsibility</h2>

<p>
  By clicking the timing button again, you can change the timing of a wire to
  "one beat earlier".
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="timing-earlier.png" />
  <figcaption>A wire can spread its pulse backwards through time.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  Let me be completely clear. If you set a wire's timing to "one beat earlier",
  it will trigger the second shape <em>before</em> the first shape is fired, in
  a way that seems to break causality and the rules of time.
</p>

<p>
  <em>This was very very hard to program.</em>
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="earlier.png" />
  <figcaption>Time travel.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  This phenomenon plays around with the concept of
  <strong>responsibility</strong>. It leans into the idea that the user is not
  <em>causing</em> the sounds of the instrument. It suggests that
  <em>Arroost itself</em>
  is responsible for whatever's happening in the simulation. The sounds playing
  are because of Arroost — not you.
</p>

<p>
  This time travel effect feels so unintuitive, and so hard to follow, that the
  user should have no hope of properly reasoning about it, or understanding
  what's going on. They should give up on trying to "own" their creation, and
  instead focus on trying to <strong>influence</strong> it.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="confusion.png" />
  <figcaption>
    I have no idea what's going on here but I like how it sounds.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  Similar to the philosophy of Electroplankton and Sound Fantasy, this focus on
  simulation serves to remove pressure from the user. It removes
  <strong>emotional blockers</strong> by lowering the stakes.
  <strong>Live programming</strong> offers this affordance of confusion, and
  it's something that we can lean into.
</p>

<p><em>"It's not my fault that it sounds bad. It's Arroost's fault."</em></p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>
  Arroost has many more features that allow for more complex behaviours. For
  example, you can change the colour of a wire by clicking on the square button.
</p>

<p>
  Coloured wires let you fire further wires conditionally, which lets you create
  more complex structures like logic gates.
</p>

<p>
  You can also create a Storage shape by <em>deleting nothing</em>. This allows
  for even more complex computations.
</p>

<p>
  However, for most users, these features are far too complicated to use. I
  would like to make this sort of creation easier in future work, but currently,
  the easiest way to get Arroost to carry out a complex behaviour is to
  <strong>perform</strong> it.
</p>

<p>
  Intentionally or otherwise, Arroost encourages
  <strong>live performance</strong>, which changes expectations around the music
  produced in it. It lowers the bar, and mistakes are expected. This is similar
  to what we see in Algorave and <strong>live coding</strong>, where mistakes
  are embraced as part of the culture.
</p>

<h2>Community</h2>

<p>
  Finally, it is worth noting that Arroost, as a tool, is not in a vacuum.
  Throughout its development, various members of the community contributed to it
  as an open source project. I introduced a mantra of "normalise sharing scrappy
  fiddles" which was picked up by community members as a way of encouraging each
  other to share their work, no matter how bad they thought it was.
</p>

<p>
  In this sense, the community around Arroost is another "feature" that serves
  to remove emotional blockers.
</p>

<p>
  This is something that I have only recently started to understand. It is
  something that I am learning from engaging more with the
  <strong>live coding</strong> world. I also see links to the community of
  Sandspiel, and fans of Maywa Denki's Nonsense Machines.
</p>

<p>
  As researchers within <strong>live programming</strong>, we should see the
  tools we make within their context. They do not exist in isolation, and it
  would be a failing to ignore the international communities that already exist
  around <strong>live programming</strong>, namely the Algorave and
  <strong>live coding</strong> communities.
</p>

<p>A tool can only succeed within a community.</p>

<p>
  I was extremely happy to see so many people use Arroost to create music and
  sounds. For a while I collected examples on my
  <a href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/arroost/examples/"
    >examples page</a
  >
  but there became too many to keep up with, so I stopped updating it.
</p>

<p>
  I was most pleased to read
  <a href="https://edibotopic.com/">Shane Crowley</a>'s
  <a href="https://edibotopic.com/blog/doing/leisure-sick/">blog post</a> about
  his experiences with Arroost. It confirmed many of my goals around the
  project. I encourage you to read it to get a first-hand account of how
  <strong>emotional blockers</strong> can be removed. Here are a few choice
  quotes:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <em
      >"Arroost was a new way of making music for me. It made the process more
      light and joyful than some of my recent painstaking DAW sessions."</em
    >
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>"My discovery of Arroost led to a sudden burst of music-making."</em>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>"Arroost got me back to a place where I could make something."</em>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Hopes</h2>

<p>
  My hope is that this project is the start of an ongoing conversation around
  the different kinds of blockers that we are trying to solve with our
  <strong>live programming</strong> tools.
</p>

<p>
  I want there to be more emphasis on the real-world
  <strong>emotional blockers</strong> that people experience. And I want that to
  become a potential angle of critique for
  <strong>live programming</strong> tools in general. I do think that it is
  already a prominent concern of many of us in this space, so I want to
  encourage everyone to discuss it more explicitly. There is no shame in
  admitting that you are trying to solve
  <strong>emotional blockers</strong> with your tool. I think it's a strength,
  so you should proudly state it.
</p>

<h2>"Feeling good" is not enough</h2>

<p>
  And I'll end on this. I do see many researchers trying to make tools that
  "feel good". But that's not enough. Sometimes, feeling good is not the same as
  feeling <strong>free</strong> from emotional blockers. Tackling your emotional
  needs is sometimes uncomfortable— it can be hard— it can make you feel bad, or
  frustrated, but I think it's worth it.
