# Definitions that don't matter

Here are some definitions that don't matter.

## What is a programming language?

It doesn't matter.

- Javascript
- CSS
- HTML
- Scratch
- Assembly
- Cellpond

I don't care if any of these are programming languages or not.

## What is a cellular automata?

Who cares. This one matters even less. Not even worth a paragraph.

## What is artificial intelligence?

*Let's all argue and nit-pick about what artificial intelligence is and isn't.*

> Actually artificial intelligence isn't actually intelligence. It's actually **artificial** intelligence.

> Actually artificial intelligence isn't actually artificial intelligence. It's actually **artificial artificial** intelligence.

## What is a definition?

> A definition is a tool<br>
> that we use to express ourselves<br>
> and communicate
>
> Sometimes the definition is for other people<br>
> and sometimes it's just for you
>
> The definition that you use<br>
> tells us something about YOU
>
> Not what you define
