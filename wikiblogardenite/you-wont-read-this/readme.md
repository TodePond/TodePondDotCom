# You probably won't read this blog post

It's true. You probably won't. Though I guess you're here right now. 

<br>

But the chances are that you won't read this blog post: You won't get to the end.

In fact, hardly anyone reads my blog posts nowadays. My [analytics](/analytics) tell me this. 

<br>

## Why

I think I write too many of them, so it's too hard to bother keeping up. 

Also, every blog post I write devalues all my other blog posts, past and future, because they don't seem so special anymore. 

When I released my first bunch, it was like "whattttttt todeponds doing blog posts now????" and now it's like "oh there's yet another todepond blog post... i'll give this one a skip".

<br>

<br>

Sure, at times I miss those days of getting instant easy views because it was novel. Sometimes I foolishly try to recreate something from the past but it never feels good. That's a lesson. 

<br>

It's the same as my videos. I try to stick with making things that I want to exist. If I'm happy with something I've made, then that's at least one person. And if I like it, it's likely that others might like it too.

If I don't like a blog post I've written, it's probable that no one will. 

<br>

<br>

The other thing is that my blog posts are mostly pressure valves for my current thoughts and moods. And I don't need *anyone* to read or like them for that to keep working. Not even me.

It's 2025 so I should probably make peace with the fact that I'm a fallible human, just like everybody else. And that means that I get influenced by the reactions I get to the things that I share, for good and for bad. 

If no one read or liked my blog posts, I wouldn't be so motivated to make them. 

Paradoxically, the best way to get people to read and like my blog posts is to care as little as possible about how many people read and like my blog posts. 

So I can get a bit stuck.

I need to remember: Don't forget toâ€”
