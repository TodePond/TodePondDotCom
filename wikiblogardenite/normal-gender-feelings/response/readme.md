So, I feel more normal gender feelings now than when I used to.

This is
because of lots of things. Some of them are obviously gender related:
like changing my name, introducing myself with certain pronouns,
starting hormones, and wearing eyeliner.

Others are not (so) obviously
gender related: climbing regularly, dancing more often, having sex,
cycling to and from places, leaving some friendships, eating a lot of
cake, being a busy bee. These are all things I've done, changes I've
made to my life, that make me feel more normal gender feelings.

<br>

I would say the latter ones, that aren't obviously gender related, have
had the biggest impact of all.

This is because I don't think you
can/your should/it isn't possible to separate gender feelings from all
your other feelings. I don't think it's right to say your gender
feelings are the cause of other feelings, or the other way around. The
feelings are mutual(ly influential). It's all joined up! It all happens
in your one brain, there's not a lot of room for separation. Thoughts
and feelings are diffuse throughout your whole self. I've said the same
thing a lot of times because that's how much I think it matters. Maybe
this is a hot take.

<br>

I can remember when I didn't feel normal about my gender *at all*.

There
were a lot of factors involved; being in a glass closet
(teachers/peers/friends knew I was trans but I wasn't 'out'); going to
high school in general; The Media; the wrong puberty.

For me, non-normal
gender feelings consist of a sense of urgency, of
needing-*this*-to-stop.

They also consist of a sense of being too big,
taking up too much space, physically/mentally/emotionally/wholly. I
still feel like this, but only when I'm having a bad time/a panic
attack/when I'm crying a lot and curled up, struggling to breathe. This
is one way I don't think they're separate.

<br>

When I was younger, I thought I was a trans woman. But at some point, I
can't remember when, that changed. Now I think of myself as non-binary
(and when I'm hungry, I'm nomnomnom-binary eyyyyy~).

Now this means more
things can make me feel not-normal gender feelings; people trying to
fem- or masc- me, getting called transfem.

Seriously thinking about the
"magic switch" thought experiment, in any direction away from myself,
makes me feel terrible. So does any mention of force-femming/accidental
transition memes. Thinking about any of these things happening make me
feel very not normal about my gender; "make it stop".

They don't feel
homely. They make me feel *aware*, like I'm observing myself too
closely. The fact these sorts of things make me feel *not* normal about
my gender, tells me that where I'm at is where I'm meant to be.

<br>

For me, normal gender feelings is a sense of being "at home" in/with/of
my body/mind/self, and not feeling very worried about it. I think
everybody should get to feel like that. 

90% of the time, this is how I
feel, because changes I've made to my life/ways my life has changed.

Anybody reading this feeling like they want to feel more at home in this
way: start doing things! They can be clearly gender related, or not. I
think you should do a mix. It's great! Take your time, enjoy the ride.

When I feel normal about my gender, when I look inwards, I feel at home,
warm, comfortable. I feel the opposite to how I feel when I get to the
house and see my housemates have left the kitchen a mess and there's
dirty dishes everywhere and the sink is full of water, the tap is
dripping, the countertops are covered in water and oil and grains of
rice, the fuckers. When that happens, I don't feel like that room is
part of my home. If I look inward and feel like that, *it had/has to stop*.

I still have gender feelings I would describe as not-normal, but they
are either in the context of poor mental health episode, the result of
an external factor making me feel a certain way, or in a positive
revelling-in-my-queerness sort of way. I sometimes feel not-normal
gender feelings during sex, but I don't mind too much. You can use it
for good, too. I guess that might approach a kink in some sense!

I hope this helps/is interesting. Take care out there lt;3 -- 17th [Magpie](https://mastodon.art/@seventeenmagpie)
