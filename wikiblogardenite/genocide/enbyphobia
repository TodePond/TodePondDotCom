A list of things people have said to my face.

"Keep walking, faggot!"

"Tranny!"

"Dyke!"

"Faggot!"

"Are you trans?"

"But I don't get it. Are you a woman or a man? Because I look at you and I see a man."

"When I look at you, I see a woman. You're a woman to me."

"But which one is it?"

"Which one do you prefer?"

"I had a phase where I was they/them too."

"I used any pronoun for a while too, while I was still figuring things out."

"So this is your first time doing this."

"So you came out recently."

"Let's call and we can figure it out together."

"You should commit to she/her. We all support you."

"You should really stop telling people that."

"But then what would you be?"

"What loo are you going to use?"

"I am so confused by you."

"Great to see another trans woman here."

"Good to see so many trans women here."

"Lu's pronouns are they/them actually."

"Lu's pronouns are she/her actually."

"Luke's quite a masculine name."

"It must be so confusing for them."

"It must be so hard for them, with their mum and all."

"And get this: She's happy with any pronoun now. He and she and they I suppose."

"I don't know why we don't see more non-binary teachers."

"I just think, you're either a man or a woman."

"He or she or they. I bet we need a card for they now too."
