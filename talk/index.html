  <h2>I am not dead yet</h2>
  <p>
    I am not dead yet, but one day I will be. Until then, I am a living thing
    that can respond and change and learn. I want to make the most of that, so I
    think it's best to do things "live" while I still can. And I'm still
    learning how to do that best. What I can do is share my personal journey
    towards liveness in my own creative work. This is the story of how and why I
    do things live: Live.

<!-- what it means to be open -->

      What it means to be open
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    As a community, as collaborators, as coders, what does it mean to be “open”?
  </p>
  <p>
    This goes way beyond “open source”. Open practice can mean opening yourself
    up to vulnerability. It can mean opening the door to outside influence. It
    can also bring great benefit and surprise.
  </p>
  <p>
    I know this because I used to work in a very closed-off way. But over the
    past ten years, I’ve gradually adopted a more open practice. I am still
    learning what it really means to be open, but I want to (openly) share
    everything I’ve learned so far about the unexpected rewards it can bring.

      Death of the tadi web
    </a>
  </h2>

  <p>
    The tadi web was a ridiculous plan to map out and combine every single
    "better computing" movement into one practice. Local-first, permacomputing,
    IndieWeb, robust first, small web, cheap web, cold-blooded software,
    freewheeling apps, and many more — the tadi web aimed to do them all.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, this was an impossible task, and the tadi web miserably died. We
    will gather to remember its short but slippy life.

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr4ACMrRq_8">
      Spatial programming without escape
    </a>
  </h2>

  <p>
    Spatial programming is a visual and interactive medium that makes use of
    spatial relationships to craft behavior. But existing approaches rely
    heavily on escape hatches. They allow the user to return to the traditional
    land of text to complete their programs, losing out on the benefits of the
    paradigm. CellPond is a novel and extreme example that removes the need for
    these escapes.

    <a class="primary" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GOeYylCMJI">
      Unblocking creation with friends
    </a>
  </h2>

  <p>
    Live programming is uniquely suited to creative work. It can remove many of
    the creative blockers that individuals experience when trying to produce it.
    But we could place much more explicit emphasis on the removal of emotional
    blockers from the creative process, as opposed to only focusing on
    intellectual blockers. Arroost is a project that seeks to do that — an
    experimental live programming tool for making music.

<!-- dialogues on natural code -->

  <h2>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV12HhAYIik">
      Dialogues on natural code
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p>This is a talk about a series of dialogues between me and Dave Ackley.</p>
  <p>
    where we fleshed out our shared interests in non-traditional machines and
    coding mechanisms. We primarily focused on the idea that all human language
    can usefully be viewed in programming language terms — as “natural code”.
    Programming languages and natural languages differ in many ways, such as
    having relatively formal definitions versus not, emphasizing strong syntax
    versus large dictionaries, and demanding rigid implementations versus
    building on the vagaries of living systems. Still, we saw deep unities as
    well, much more than mere metaphor, and we glimpsed the possibility of
    applying humanity’s decades of programming language design and software
    engineering experience to the task of debugging and refactoring the natural
    codebase that we all share. These fragmentary and overlapping dialogues
    represent both a description and an example of natural code, and we offer
    them here, with a simple “natural API” illustration, in hopes of programming
    people to join in natural code development.
