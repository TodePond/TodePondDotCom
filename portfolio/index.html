    <h2>SandPond, 2019</h2>

    <p>
      I created SandPond, a 3D voxel sandbox, as well as SpaceTode, a spatial
      programming language that lets you create elements in the simulation by
      drawing before-and-after pictures. I documented my progress in a series of
      videos that's known as the SandPond Saga. SandPond is now finished, but
      the series continues to this day!

    <h2>CellPond, 2021</h2>

    </p>
    <p>
      I created CellPond based on everything I learned from SandPond. Unlike
      SandPond, you can code it entirely by dragging-and-dropping shapes around
      in its visual programming interface, which was its main design constraint.
      Building CellPond pushed me towards adopting some radical UX decisions and
      I ended up learning a lot about canvas interface design.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've published work on CellPond in various places: For example, I
      presented it at LIVE 2023 at the SPLASH conference, and I gave a workshop
      about it at ICLC 2025.
