# Underground cardboard

Underground cardboard keeping up our city,\
Tube drivers melting at the wheel or levers or whatever they use, \
The man on the street who always sells hot dogs past ten, \
The woman sitting on cardboard next to him,\
Next to the sign that says she can't be there,\
Next to the starbucks I use when I need the loo at night,\
Past the station shops,\
Overpriced for all the commuting workers, \
Overtime for all the workers working there, \
The same ones each day, \
The same each day,\
Standing by the samaritan sign at the end of the platform,\
Wondering if it works, \
Watching the man who comes and stands on the end at busy times,\
Just to keep an eye on things, \
Just in case it doesn't work.
