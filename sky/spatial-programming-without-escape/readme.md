# SPATIAL PROGRAMMING WITHOUT ESCAPE


maybe- AMOGUS
yes- SHOW ALL THE FUNKY PAINT AND FUNKY RULES FIRST BUT THEN COMPLETELY STRIP IT BACK WHEN SHOWING THE LARGER RULES. 

CELLPOND
SPATIAL PROGRAMMING
WITHOUT ESCAPE

THIS PRESENTATION WILL GO AS FOLLOWS
PART ONE SPATIAL PROGRAMMING
PART TWO CELLPOND
PART THREE WITHOUT ESCAPE

LET'S GET STARTED

# PART ONE: SPATIAL PROGRAMMING 

*23 years ago*

I WAS 6 YEARS OLD
I LOVED TRAINS
I ALSO LOVED COMPUTERS
-
SO I WAS REALLY EXCITED
WHEN OUR CLASS GOT TAUGHT HOW TO CODE
WITH SOMETHING CALLED
STAGECAST CREATOR

IT WORKS LIKE THIS
YOU DRAG AND DROP TO MAKE SPATIAL RULES
YOU BUILD A *BEFORE* AND *AFTER* PICTURE
*WHEN* THIS HAPPENS
*THEN* THIS HAPPENS


WHEN.. THERE'S SPACE
TO THE RIGHT OF MY CHARACTER
THEN.. THEY MOVE RIGHT

WHEN.. THERE'S AN OBSTACLE
THEN.. JUMP OVER IT

WHEN... THERE'S AN ITEM
THEN... PICK IT UP
AND CARRY IT

IT'S A SPATIAL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
BECAUSE YOU CODE IT BY
BUILDING SPATIAL REWRITE RULES


REWRITE *THIS* SPATIAL PATTERN
INTO.. THIS ONE 

AT THE TIME
THIS WAS A POPULAR STYLE OF VISUAL CODING
WHERE YOU HAVE SOME CELLS ON A GRID
AND SOME RULES
THE RULES TELL THE CELLS WHAT TO DO

THEY ALSO LOVED TRAINS BACK THEN
THEY REALLY LOVED TRAINS

BUT IT WAS SO TRICKY
TO MAKE A TRAIN MOVE AROUND A TRACK
WITH SPATIAL PROGRAMMING

AND IT WAS REALLY TRICKY
TO MAKE TWO THINGS ACT THE SAME WAY

SO THEY CAME UP WITH ALL SORTS OF
DETAILED SOLUTIONS FOR TRAINS

BUT UNFORTUNATELY
THESE WERE VERY TRAIN SPECIFIC SOLUTIONS
SO THEY DIDN'T APPLY WELL
TO OTHER PROBLEMS

SO THEY GAVE UP ON SPATIAL PROGRAMMING
AND TURNED TO THIS INSTEAD
LOOK FAMILIAR?

SPATIAL PROGRAMMING DIED
(AWW)

JUST KIDDING

THERE'S SPLAT
BY DAVE ACKLEY
A SPATIAL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE FOR
A NEW KIND OF COMPUTER HARDWARE
USING A ROBUST FIRST APPROACH

--

THERE'S COLOR CODE
A BEAUTIFUL ARTISTIC PUZZLE
BY MURILO POLESE

--

THERE'S NETBIODYN
A BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY SIMULATION
INTENDED FOR RESEARCH

-- 

THERE'S VISCUIT
ANOTHER EDUCATIONAL TOOL
THAT DEMONSTRATES SPATIAL PROGRAMMING
WITHOUT A GRID

--

AND I MADE MY OWN ONE TOO
THIS IS SANDPOND
YOU CODE IT LIKE THIS
TO MAKE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS

LIKE SAND
WATER
ROCK
FIRE
LAVA
CHEESE

--

SPATIAL PROGRAMMING IS USED
FOR EDUCATION
FOR HARDWARE
FOR ART
FOR SIMULATION
FOR GAMES

**IT'S GENERAL PURPOSE**
IT'S WORTHY OF OUR ATTENTION

BUT ALL OF THESE TOOLS ...
HAVE A DARK
AND TERRIBLE
SECRET

CAN YOU SPOT IT?
...
YOU CAN'T BECAUSE
YOU NEED TO UNCROP THESE IMAGES

THESE TOOLS MAKE HEAVY USE
OF ESCAPE HATCHES

YOU CAN ESCAPE TO THE WORLD OF TEXT
IF YOU WANT MORE COMPLEX BEHAVIOUR

STAGECAST IS HARDER TO FIND
YOU HAVE TO CLICK THIS YELLOW TAB
OR THIS ONE
AND YOU CAN SEE
THAT THIS ISN'T ACTUALLY A SPATIAL RULE
IT'S A SET OF INSTRUCTIONS

IF YOU WANT MORE FINE GRAINED CONTROL
YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THESE LINES OF CODE

COLOR CODE DOESN'T HAVE AN ESCAPE HATCH
BUT IT'S MORE LIMITED
IS THAT THE CHOICE?

LIMITED, WITHOUT ESCAPE
POWERFUL, WITH ESCAPE

COULD WE MAKE SOMETHING THAT'S...
POWERFUL, WITHOUT ESCAPE

IS IT POSSIBLE?
WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE?
WILL THERE BE ANY UNEXPECTED AND ENLIGHTENING LESSONS ALONG THE WAY?

BUT NOW
# PART TWO: CELLPOND

I MADE ANOTHER SPATIAL PROGRAMMING TOOL
CALLED CELLPOND
AND I WANT TO SHOW IT TO YOU



THIS IS CELLPOND
YOU CAN PAINT IT

AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE TOP LEFT
WE'RE CURRENTLY PAINTING WHITE

BUT YOU CAN PULL THAT OFF
AND OPEN IT UP TO LOOK INSIDE

YOU MIGHT KNOW THIS
BUT EVERY COLOUR ON YOUR SCREEN
IS MADE UP OF RED GREEN AND BLUE

YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR COLOUR
BY CHANGING
THE RED GREEN AND BLUE CHANNELS

IF YOU CAN'T DECIDE
YOU CAN PICK A RANGE OF COLOURS

OR REMOVE A CHANNEL
TO JUST PAINT SOME OF THEM

LOOK AT THIS TRIANGLE
YOU CAN SPIN IT ROUND

POINT IT UP AND PUT IT IN A CHANNEL
TO INCREASE THAT CHANNELS STRENGTH
OR DOWN TO DECREASE

POINT IT LEFT
TO COPY FROM THE CHANNEL ON THE LEFT
OR RIGHT
FOR THE CHANNEL ON THE RIGHT

YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED
THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE ANY CODING YET

THAT'S OK
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LET YOU
PLAY WITH THE SYSTEM FIRST
I WANT YOU TO EXPLORE IT
AND GET COMFORTABLE

WE DID THE SAME THING FOR SANDSPIEL STUDIO
BUT THAT'S A [DIFFERENT PRESENTATION](http://www.youtube.com/live/4GOeYylCMJI?t=12475)

(DEMO CONTINUES)

# PART 3: WITHOUT ESCAPE

LET'S LOOK BACK AT OUR QUESTIONS

POWERFUL SPATIAL PROGRAMMING
WITHOUT ESCAPE

IS IT POSSIBLE?
YES

WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE?
MAYBE THIS

ANY UNEXPECTED LESSONS?

CELLPOND'S MAIN INNOVATION
IS NOT ITS UI

ITS MAIN INNOVATION IS ITS VIRTUAL MACHINE
WHICH IS CALLED DRAGON
YOU KNOW... LIKE "DRAG'N DROP"

IT HAS FOUR INSTRUCTIONS
GET
RECOLOUR
SPLIT
MERGE

READ MEMORY
WRITE MEMORY
ALLOCATE MEMORY
DEALLOCATE MEMORY

ONCE THOSE PRIMITIVES WERE SORTED OUT
EVERYTHING ELSE FELL INTO PLACE

THIS IS HOW I THINK ABOUT IT
IF WE MAP OUT ALL LANGUAGES
FROM LOW LEVEL TO HIGH LEVEL
