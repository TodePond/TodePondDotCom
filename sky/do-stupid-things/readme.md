# Make stupid things

Make stupid things. Make stupid sounds. Make stupid pictures. Make stupid videos. Make stupid stories. Make stupid jokes. Make stupid sentences. Make stupid poems. Make stupid blog posts. Make stupid decisions. Make stupid things. 

Sing stupid songs. Paint stupid paintings. Draw stupid drawings. Sculpt stupid sculptures. Weave stupid weavings. Embroider stupid embroiderings. Orchestrate stupid orchestras. Film stupid films. Walk stupid walks. Dance stupid dances. Run stupid runs. Jump stupid jumps. Stupid stupid stupids.

Be free! to do the stupid things! that set you free!

Do all the stupid things! you know are stupid! but you want to do anyway!

When I die! I'll not regret! doing stupid things!

I'll regret! not doing! enough!
