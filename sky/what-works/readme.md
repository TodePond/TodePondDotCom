# What works for me and how I think about it

lol i'm so random

I'm [just] so weird guys aren't I

classic me

I'm so quirky and unique aren't I

<br>

no really i am though. i guess its a big part of my identity: to be a bit weird / different / whatever

i mean how much can i actually say that as a white middle class privately educated assigned-male-at-birth tech bro i don't know? yet i do feel weird 

i'm pretty sure this blog post is the kind of thing i'll read back in a [THIS WORD TO BE FILLED IN BY FUTURE LU] from now and cringe heavily at. that's why i'm beginning it with all this [lampshading](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging).

Sometimes people ask me mockingly flattering questions like "how do you make so much stuff" (i don't) and (ugh) 

"why are you so great lu"

"lu you inspired me to blah blah blah"

"where do you get all your CRAZY ideas from"

"what do you think about (completely unrelated thing)"

Ha! I bet some of you don't understand why these people say these things to me. Well luckily for you, I *do* know why they say these things but it's not because I'm any good at anything:

It's because I'm a *white middle class privately educated assigned-male-at-birth tech bro*.

I've had the privilege of spending my whole life privileged. How did you think I had all that time to do all this? When I was younger I didn't need to worry about working my arse off like many of my friends did. I didn't need to try hard to get into uni because my school scooped me through on a silver spoon no wait thats the wrong way round the uni came to ME on a silver spoon

and now i have a big enough tech salary that i can also not worry on a seven day uhh

i don't need to work my arse off six or seven days a week like many of my friends do. i don't have to look after kids or dependants or anything. i don't have to care for anyone and also i have plenty of room to relax and unwind and do creative stuff

i have it pretty good. so don't come to me asking for advice on those things because i have it easy easier than you. so really what you wanna do is—

"but Lu"

please don't interrupt me in the middle of my—

"no but Lu"

!!

"sorry to interrupt, but—"

that's my line 

"you said that you have it easier than me."

yes. because I'm a white middle class privately educated assigned-male-at-birth tech bro.

"but Lu."

what is it? 

"I'm *also* a white middle class privately educated assigned-male-at-birth tech bro *too*"

yes i suspected as much. also you don't need to say "too" when you've already said "also" in the sentence.
