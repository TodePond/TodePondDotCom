<p>i think one of my favourite parts of &quot;pop live coding&quot; is that you can hear that catchy melody getting &quot;grown&quot; in real-time slowly: through stumbles and bumps and mistakes. it goes from wonky to iconic in front of your eyes! (ears?)</p>

<p>the struggle is almost endearing / funny</p><p>anyway i think i know what I&#39;m doing at next AlgoRhythms, will be quite experimental</p>

<p>coming soon: todepop</p>
