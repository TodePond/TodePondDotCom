# NO MORE TEXT

"what is the purpose of the universe?"

doesn't make sense as a question. it's like asking: "why does a square have ears?" or "what is 983 divided by elephant". in all cases, you can't give an answer - not because there is no answer, but because there is no question. 

<br>

like you, i became subjected to existence through no fault of my own. neither of us had any say in the matter.

nonetheless, we are here, thrusted onto the whims and wonders and wtfs of the world, though certainly not all of them. (we all get a slightly different experience.

and we all get a slightly different language.

<br>

the worst language of all the languages is text.

yes, text is truly the worst language of all. especially written text. spoken text is slightly better but still dreadful.

even worse than written text is typed text. you are reading typed text right now. feel how awful it is.

<br>

text emerged over the course of far too many years as a way of communicating things on flat things like cave walls and phones

it's used for too many things

<br>

questions like "what is the purpose of the universe?" or 'what is the purpose of life" or "what is the meaning of life" all get let down by text. those questions— our languages— text doesn't

if you want to tackle anything [---] you hit a brick wall with text.

the best writers in the world know that it's "what you don't say" that's most powerfu.l the unspoken word does so much more than the spoken one. because the unspoken word makes [---] in the reader's head. because if you spell everything out for them it makes them [---]. because it means they don't have to do any work. because there is no [---] to solve.

and without powerful communication, we're all fucked!

<br>

look around you: text rules the world. from the ridiculous to the [---]. on the one hand we've got the president of the united states using text to tweet out retruths on one of two nazi microblogging sites. and all of the anti-nazi nerds are microblogging somewhere else. and all of the anti-microbloggimg nerds are writing normal blogs. and all of the anti-blog nerds are writing emails. and all of the anti-tech nerds are reading books - filled to the brim with disgusting TEXT.

some people are supposedly anti-text but won't stop writing text about that. while everyone else is still living in a world ruled by rules written in text, known as laws. everyone works away at their work contracts written in text in their jobs where they coordinate with others increasingly through text.

text is not throwaway. text sticks around. if you say some text or you write some text in 2026, then it sticks around.

and now, large language models bring us into the beloved Future of Computing of Coding of Work of Text... all by using / through our precious language: our special format: our holy bible: our mother tongue: TEXT. yes. TEXT. and not anything else.

OUR FAULT\
is using\
too much text 

i don't think i can bring myself to say it: "NO MORE TEXT" but [some people can](https://post.lurk.org/@yaxu/115843608016733825)

and at what cost? 

some people confuse text for communication / text for information. there is so much more to messaging than text. don't get them caught up in the crossfire

over the past 14(?) months i've been encountering a different (not new) way to communicate that doesn't involve text. listen, to try it out, all you need to do is [---].

it's simple. you [just] [---]. and [---]. with the [---] the best thing to do is [---].

but don't [---]. from time to time you gotta [---]. [---].

[---]).
