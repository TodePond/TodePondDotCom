# Declaration of liveness 

I, Lu Wilson, hereby declare that I won't do **any** live coding performance unless the audience is also allowed to join in and perform with me. I wholeheartedly swear that every single one of my live coding performances will be open for the audience to join, no matter what.

<br>

This means: If you are watching or listening to me perform, then you can join in. I will usually make it clear how to do that at the start of the performance. If you missed the explanation, then please ask me during the performance. 

Remember:

> If you can see me\
> If you can hear me\
> You can join me

<br>

<br>

<br>

Be careful about making this declaration yourself. It has some heavy implications.

- If I'm doing some live coding as part of a public livestream, then anyone in the world will be able to join it.
- If I'm doing some live coding as part of a talk or demo, then anyone in the audience will be able to join it.
- I can't and won't perform at any event where the organiser is not happy for this to happen.

<br>

Practically, tools like [flok](https://flok.cc) are helpful for this. It lets people join from their phone even, from all around the world. But people can join by [just](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/) joining me on stage and making some sounds or sights instead. We don't need any fancy technology for it to happen.

<br>

I will do this for a one year and review after that. 

Join me for the review on the 15th April 2026.
