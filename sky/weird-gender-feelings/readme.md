# Weird gender feelings

A while ago, I wrote a blog post called [normal gender feelings](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogardenite/normal-gender-feelings/) and some other trans people hated it. They thought it was problematic.

I think it comes down to misunderstanding.

Most trans people get told that they're "weird" throughout their life. Whether it's by a bully on the playground, or a parent wishing you were "normal", or society at large calling you a freak... it's a pretty common occurrence, and it's not very nice. 

The blog post tried to do two things about this. 

## 1. Reclaim weirdness

I don't think it's bad to be weird.

If you think it's bad to be weird, then fuck you!

In the blog post, I talked about the weird gender feelings I felt for most of my life. I don't care that they're weird. I'm proud of it! 

## 2. Flip the weirdness

I think we should flip around what's considered a weird thing to do. 

If you feel weird about your gender, then it would be weird to do nothing about it! If you have weird gender feelings, the normal thing to do should be to transition in the way that you want. That's not so weird. Are you following? Hmm...

The world, at large, does not agree with this idea. Transitioning is seen as weird, but it should be normal.
