# Importance

Whenever I sit down to write something on my blog or do anything creative at all, I always wonder what's most important to do.

<br>

<br>

I feel pulled in different directions, at times.

On the one hand there are the emotions that I experience that pull me towards expressing myself, where my work is my outlet / release valve for getting out my feelings.

On the other hand I know that I have an audience who listens to me, to an extent. And although it's small, I know some people would kill for the platform I have, and they would put it to much better use than I do.

So what do I do? what do I do?

## The planet is dying

America is already dead, and we're next in line.

The forces that want this to happen have huge social influence, through media, surveillance, and everything else. It can seem like a seemingly impossible foe to defeat / resist, but their strength is their weakness: The right wingers live and breathe top down control: The few control the many: That's the whole point of their game!

What they lack is bottom up, distributed effort. Put simply: There's more of us. We have a higher ceiling on the scale of our movement. But to scale well, we can't adopt the same top down approach. We can't have only one small group in charge. 

<br>

In UK politics, there are more left wingers than right wingers, but we have historically failed to hold power because we all compete with each other instead of the real enemy: Right wing cunts.

And when we do "win", we don't really, because we only end up with the fake left wing / our current right wing shitshow of a government: The miserable Labour party. The miserable Labour party pulls out policies from its arse that none of us want, like [trans](https://transactual.org.uk/blog/2024/08/23/statement-on-the-extended-ban-on-puberty-blockers/) and [beaver](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/14/no-10-blocks-beaver-release-plan-tory-legacy) eradication.

For real left wing victory, we need to cooperate. We need left wing movements to drop their stiff upper lip and to communicate and to work together, and Yes that includes Labour: We need Labour to need us because we need to bully them into behaving.

*Did you know that Labour party members voted to put forward highly important vote reform at their annual conference this year? But the top down leaders of the party shut it down. The Labour party is sick because it's being ruled by cunts who ignore the masses that ask for them to cooperate.*

AAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHH

## Better computing

The same thing happens in computing / in the "future of coding" world. Everyone has some great [idea](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/my-wikiblogarden/no-more-ideas) that will end up [changing the world](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogardenite/no/more/ideas/in/the/world/) and it's *their* idea that'll do it: Not anyone else's, but there one, because they think they're right. This sick sick top down mentality infects us all and need to let it die, we need to let it die.

## Importance

So when deciding what to write about—

So do I write about my feelings? Or do I write about what's important? 

Well...

What I do know is— One thing I know to be important is— Compromise is important. That's what I know. And like with most things in life, it's not [one or the other](https://www.todepond.com/report/definitions-that-dont-matter/).

So when I write a blog post, do I write my feelings? Or do I write what's important? 

<br>

WHY NOT BOTH???????
