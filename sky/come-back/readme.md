# Come back

Oh hello! I didn't recognise you! 

Yes I need a haircut. 

Me too! This rain...

Yes. 

It's too much. 

Yes it is. 

<br>

Are you still working at [redacted]?

Yes, yes I am still working at [redacted].

How's it all going there at [redacted]?

Oh, you know. It's the same.

You should come visit! People would love to see you.

Oh yeah, I mean...

So what are you up to now?

Ah well, uhh, I'm a "software engineer", making, you know, virtual whiteboard software. 

Oh wow! Probably better than the one we use at [redacted].

Haha I don't know. I mean, that's the idea. 

That sounds exciting. 

Yeah. Well yeah I enjoy it a lot.

But I miss teaching a lot.

Well, you know, you can always come back.
