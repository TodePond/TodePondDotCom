Funny questions people ask me when I show them a live coding tool.

"What's the use case?"

"Who's your main competition?"

"So are you looking to start a business around this, or—"

"What's the point? I mean sure it can make music but—"

"How do you monetize?"

"Do you think this will pick up?"

"Are you the founder?"

"How big is the team?"

"Are you hiring?"

"Are you raising?"

"What's your go-to-market strategy?"

"Is this AI?"

"So an LLM is powering this?"

"What model are you using?"

"Sorry. It's very impressive and all but I just don't see it working out."
