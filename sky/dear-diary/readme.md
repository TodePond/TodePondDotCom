Dear diary,

Today I cleared out my childhood room and I rediscovered you / my old diary that I used to write in when I was a young teenager. 

Re-reading you / Re-reading the diary made me cringe. I also found it quite sad / upsetting. I was clearly quite unhappy back then in those moments. I was really struggling to come to terms with the changes my body was going through at the time. I felt different and alone, and I didn't have the courage to tell anyone about why that might be: Not even you.

I had clearly given up on making my situation any better. I hated myself, and sometimes that hatred spilled out towards others around me, in my writing.

My writing included: A far-too-detailed multi-chapter analysis of the social dynamics of my school.

My writing included: A full-page explanation of why I love my bed so much, and why it's the only thing keeping me alive(!).

<br>

God, it feels like a million miles away now, but I guess that experience is still part of me, somehow. 

It can be taboo to talk about these things, but looking back, I am very very pleased that I made it through and successfully became a trans adult rather than [just another statistic](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/blog/anti-transgender-laws-cause-up-to-72-increase-in-suicide-attempts-among-transgender-and-nonbinary-youth-study-shows/).

Those old diary pages... They make me cringe, but they also give me some direct connection to my younger self. They give me some unfiltered insight into how I used to be. It's a way for teenager Lu to speak to fifteen years into the future Lu: Over my full life's years away.

Unfortunately, I can't respond. But if I could... I would say that (a) That's very cringe, and (b) I am still writing cringe diary entries decades later, and I somehow justify it by calling it a [wikiblogardenite](/wikiblogardenite).
