# One beat style

Last year I wrote a style guide for [two beat style](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/style/two-beat/) and some of you seemed to like it. It went down quite well. 

The rules are: You must stick to words that are two syllab— I mean— You must stick to words that are two beats long (or less). All words must be two beats or less long.

And I can now do two beat style quite well! It's not that hard for me now, not like it used to be. I got good at it, and now I can switch to it when I talk out loud, if I want to.

But the style of this blog post is not two beat style. This is **one** beat style. It's much worse. It's when you stick to words with ONE beat or less. And I'm not so good at one beat style, but I know that I'll learn how to do it some day. Each day I try it, I get a bit more good at it. 

At times, when I show off my two beat style skills, I like to switch to one beat style for a line or two, just as a bit of a flex at the end.

What do you think? Give it a go! and tell me how you get on. Can you speak with one beat style? or is it too hard?
