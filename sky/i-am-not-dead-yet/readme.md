I am not dead yet, but one day I will be.

I am not dead yet, but I will be one day. Until then, I am a living thing that can respond and change, so it makes sense to do things "live". In fact, I'm not sure how I *couldn't* do things "live".

When I am dead, I will continue to change, but not in any way that's appealing to me. The changes I want are happening now.

What does it mean to be alive?

If you are reading this abstract, then you are alive, just like me. 

What does it mean to be live?

My code is dead but I am not.

<br>

As a community, as collaborators, as coders, what does it mean to be "live"?

This goes way beyond "live coding". Live practice can mean opening yourself up to vulnerability. It can mean opening the door to outside influence. It can also bring great benefit and surprise.

I know this because I used to work in a very non-live way. But over the past ten years, I’ve gradually adopted a more live practice. I am still learning what it really means to be live, but I want to share everything I’ve learned so far about the unexpected rewards it can bring.

Normalise sharing scrappy fiddles!

<br>

What's the point of "doing it live"?

Why be live?

<br>

Why do we do things "live"?

Why do you do things "live"?

For now, I am alive. 

Why do we do things "live"? Why don't we prepare everything ahead of time? It would probably look and sound a lot better. 

When I do things "live" I sacrifice a lot. The quality of my work goes way down, and it's much more nerve-wracking.

HI\
MY NAME IS LU

AND I AM NOT DEAD YET\
BUT ONE DAY I WILL BE

FOR NOW I AM ALIVE

WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? TO BE ALIVE.\
IT MEANS A LOT.\
1. I CAN DO THINGS / I CAN ACT\
2. I CAN EXPERIENCE THINGS / I CAN REACT\
3. I CAN CHANGE\
(MAYBE MORE) (THIS IS NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST)

WHAT I DO IS... I MAKE STUPID THINGS ON THE\ INTERNET\
AS TODEPOND

I'M PART OF A COLLECTIVE\
CALLED TENTPOLE

AND I'M PART OF A GROUP\
CALLED PASTAGANG\
BUT THAT'S NOT SAYING MUCH\
BECAUSE THEY LET ANYONE JOIN

<br>

THE NAME OF MY TALK IS\
"I AM NOT DEAD YET"

PART ONE WILL BE\
"I AM NOT DEAD"

PART TWO WILL BE\
"YET"

THERE WILL BE NO PART THREE

SO...\
WHY\
WHY BE LIVE\
WHY DO THINGS LIVE, ON THE SPOT, FROM SCRATCH OR OTHERWISE? WHY NOT PLAN OR RECORD THINGS AHEAD OF TIME? WHY DO WE DO THINGS LIVE? 

I HAVE NO IDEA

<br>

I'M HONOURED TO BE HERE TODAY\
TO GIVE THIS TALK\
THIS IS A TALK\
WHICH MEANS I'M HERE PRESENTING TO YOU LIVE\
MAYBE YOU'RE WATCHING ON A RECORDING\
BUT I PROMISE YOU I AM REALLY HERE\
DOING IT LIVE

<br>

ONE DAY I WILL BE DEAD

<br>

THE THEME OF THIS CONFERENCE IS LIVENESS\
WHAT IT MEANS\
WHAT MAKES SOMETHING LIVE OR NOT

IT'S ACTUALLY VERY HARD FOR ME TO ACT IN A WAY THAT IS *NOT* LIVE.\
BECAUSE I AM NOT DEAD YET.\
I AM ALIVE.

<br>

I AM NOT DEAD YET\
AND NEITHER ARE YOU
