I AM NOT DEAD

I AM NOT DEAD YET

BUT ONE DAY I WILL BE

I AM GOING TO DIE\
FOR NOW I AM ALIVE\
WHICH MEANS\
I CAN BE HERE\
LIVE\
SPEAKING TO YOU NOW\
LIVE\
RIGHT NOW\
WHICH MEANS\
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN

<br>

EXCEPT...\
THAT'S NOT REALLY TRUE, IS IT?

I MEAN\
SURE, I'M STANDING HERE\
LIVE\
RIGHT NOW\
BUT I'M GIVING YOU\
A HIGHLY REHEARSED\
PRE-SCRIPTED TALK

THIS DOESN'T FEEL LIVE TO ME\
THIS MAY AS WELL BE A RECORDING \
THAT YOU WATCH\
TWO WEEKS FROM NOW

--

LOOK\
I HAVE ALL MY SLIDES\
PRE-PREPARED HERE

WITH MY NOTES AT THE BOTTOM\
TELLING ME EXACTLY WHAT TO SAY

HERE'S WHERE I SAY\
HI I'M LU\
I MAKE STUPID VIDEOS\
ABOUT MY CODING PROJECTS\
BLAH BLAH BLAH

I'M PART OF A COLLECTIVE CALLED TENTPOLE\
I'M PART OF A GROUP CALLED PASTAGANG\
BLAH BLAH BLAH

AND I KEEP GOING THROUGH MY SLIDES\
UNTIL I GET TO...\
until I get to... the... end

yeah\
so\
now that i've got to the end of my slides\
now i really am live\
right now\
and anything can happen

(giggle menacingly)

except...\
that's not really true, is it? \
because even this\
is heavily rehearsed\
and pre-scripted

what you're seeing on the screen\
is not actually live\
it's actually a recording\
that I recorded\
two weeks ago

look\
it's a video

and i still have my script here\
so this talk may as well be a recording\
that you watch two weeks from now

ARE YOU FOLLOWING SO FAR?\
YOU'RE FOLLOWING, RIGHT?

THIS IS A TALK ABOUT LIVENESS\
WHICH IS RIDICULOUS\
BECAUSE A TALK IS\
ONE OF THE LEAST LIVE THINGS\
YOU CAN DO

ON THE SCALE OF LIVENESS\
FROM LEAST LIVE\
TO MOST LIVE\
I'M ABOUT HERE\
RIGHT NOW

I AM NOT LIVE\
I AM NOT LIVE YET

<br>

SO...\
LET'S DO AN EXPERIMENT\
SHALL WE TRY SOMETHING OUT?

LET'S GRADUALLY INCREASE\
THE LIVENESS OF THIS TALK \
UNTIL IT GETS "TOO LIVE"\
AND WE'LL TRY TO FIND THE SWEETSPOT

ALRIGHT? 

ARE YOU UP FOR THAT?

ARE YOU READY?

LET'S DO A LIVE DEMO

(PASTAGANG CREATIONS)

(PONDIVERSE DEMO)

(TWIRL DEMO)\
LIVENESS CAN MEAN ANYTHING WE WANT IT TO MEAN.\
I THINK:\
LIVENESS IS NOT A FEATURE OR A TOOL.\
LIVENESS IS NOT SOMETHING AN INDIVIDUAL DOES.\
LIVENESS IS SOMETHING WE DO TOGETHER.\
LIVENESS IS A RELATIONSHIP WE SHARE. IT'S ABOUT HOW WE RELATE TO EACH OTHER. IT'S ABOUT LETTING OTHERS IN, GIVING UP CONTROL.

LISTEN.\
I HAVE ONE LIFE.\
I DIDN'T ASK TO BE BORN.\
BUT HERE I AM.\
I HAVE ONE LIFE.\
I'M LIVE.\
RIGHT NOW.

## Long keynote description

I am not dead yet, but one day I will be. Until then, I am a living thing that can respond and change and learn. I want to make the most of that, so I think it's best to do things "live" while I still can. And I'm still learning how to do that best.

What I can do is share my personal journey towards liveness in my own creative work. This is the story of how and why I do things live: Live.

<br>

I CAN'T PROMISE YOU THAT ANYTHING I SAY WILL BE CORRECT.\
BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT IT WILL BE DEEPLY AND INTENSELY PERSONAL.

selfimage api, maybe not i dunno, too unreal? save it for something where it can be the main focus. don't want to distract from real connections

to be present to have to be live\
you have to be live to be present\
being live means being here\
one day i will be dead \
my output / the music / the artifacts i make may stick around\
but i will be gone / i will no longer be present

I AM NOT DEAD YET

WHAT IT MEANS TO BE LIVE

CURRENTLY UNTITLED KEYNOTE

LIVE CODING MYSELF

DEAD CODING

TO SCRATCH

<br>

<hr>

<br>

I am not dead yet, but one day I will be.

I am not dead yet, but I will be one day. Until then, I am a living thing that can respond and change, so it makes sense to do things "live". In fact, I'm not sure how I *couldn't* do things "live".

When I am dead, I will continue to change, but not in any way that's appealing to me. The changes I want are happening now. 

What does it mean to be alive?

If you are reading this abstract, then you are alive, just like me. 

What does it mean to be live?

My code is dead but I am not.

<br>

As a community, as collaborators, as coders, what does it mean to be "live"?

This goes way beyond "live coding". Live practice can mean opening yourself up to vulnerability. It can mean opening the door to outside influence. It can also bring great benefit and surprise.

I know this because I used to work in a very non-live way. But over the past ten years, I’ve gradually adopted a more live practice. I am still learning what it really means to be live, but I want to share everything I’ve learned so far about the unexpected rewards it can bring.

Normalise sharing scrappy fiddles!

<br>

What's the point of "doing it live"?

Why be live?

<br>

Why do we do things "live"?

Why do you do things "live"?

For now, I am alive. 

Why do we do things "live"? Why don't we prepare everything ahead of time? It would probably look and sound a lot better. 

When I do things "live" I sacrifice a lot. The quality of my work goes way down, and it's much more nerve-wracking.

<br>

<br>

HI\
MY NAME IS LU

AND I AM NOT DEAD YET\
BUT ONE DAY I WILL BE

FOR NOW I AM ALIVE

WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? TO BE ALIVE.\
WHAT IS ALIVENESS\
WHAT IS ALIVE CODING

IT MEANS A LOT.\
1. I CAN DO THINGS / I CAN ACT\
2. I CAN EXPERIENCE THINGS / I CAN REACT\
3. I CAN CHANGE\
(MAYBE MORE) (THIS IS NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST)

WHAT I DO IS... I MAKE STUPID THINGS ON THE INTERNET\
AS TODEPOND

I'M PART OF A COLLECTIVE\
CALLED TENTPOLE

AND I'M PART OF A GROUP\
CALLED PASTAGANG\
BUT THAT'S NOT SAYING MUCH\
BECAUSE THEY LET ANYONE JOIN

<br>

THE NAME OF MY TALK IS\
"I AM NOT DEAD YET"

PART ONE WILL BE\
"I AM NOT DEAD"

PART TWO WILL BE\
"YET"

THERE WILL BE NO PART THREE

I AM NOT DEAD YET\
BUT ONE DAY I WILL BE

FOR NOW I AM ALIVE

WHICH IS FUN\
BECAUSE THE THEME OF THIS EVENT \
IS ALIVENESS\
OR LIVENESS\
ALIVENESS

SO...\
WHY\
WHY BE LIVE\
WHY DO THINGS LIVE, ON THE SPOT, FROM SCRATCH OR OTHERWISE? WHY NOT PLAN OR RECORD THINGS AHEAD OF TIME? WHY DO WE DO THINGS LIVE? 

I HAVE NO IDEA

<br>

I'M HONOURED TO BE HERE TODAY\
TO GIVE THIS TALK\
THIS IS A TALK\
WHICH MEANS I'M HERE PRESENTING TO YOU LIVE\
MAYBE YOU'RE WATCHING ON A RECORDING\
BUT I PROMISE YOU I AM REALLY HERE\
DOING IT LIVE

<br>

ONE DAY I WILL BE DEAD

<br>

THE THEME OF THIS CONFERENCE IS LIVENESS\
WHAT IT MEANS\
WHAT MAKES SOMETHING LIVE OR NOT

IT'S ACTUALLY VERY HARD FOR ME TO ACT IN A WAY THAT IS *NOT* LIVE.\
BECAUSE I AM NOT DEAD YET.\
I AM ALIVE.

<br>

I AM NOT DEAD YET\
AND NEITHER ARE YOU
