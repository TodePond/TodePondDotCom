# The internet can be good

when I was young, the internet introduced itself to me as this wonderful yet scary presence or place that you can open yourself up to and learn new things from or try new things at. 

I didn't know or understand what it was, but then again, no one did. it was this unknowable unseeable "thing" that you can prod / that prods you back when you prod it.

back then, the internet was something you "spent time on". being connected to the internet meant making the active decision to "surf the web". it was different to the "always online" experience of the web we now experience. 

even back then, I knew that the internet wasn't a— the internet is [just](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/better-computing/just/) a manifestation of people's—

everything on the internet was once put there by a person. if you see something on the internet, it's because someone put it there / made the active decision to place it there to be prodded. for me, this made it clear that the internet was a window into other people's lives around the world.

the people you connect to / you prod over the internet may be good people (worth prodding) or they may be bad people (warning: do not prod. it is dangerous to prod them).

## Reaching 

You can reach a lot of people over the internet. You can get messages in front of their face. You can get information back from them too. You can have a back-and-forth interaction. It goes without saying that the scale— The internet let us reach people at a scale never before seen by the human race. The ability to reach people over the internet / at internet scale is—

Advertising selling spying became internet scale fast. "Influencing" with a lower case— Nudging became so much easier. Bad people learned to become the middleman of our internet interactions, giving them grand control over our communications. If Mark Zuckerterd owns our interactions then he can prod us every time we send a message, injecting his own malware into us.

Bad people run these bad companies because they have no moral conscience and only care about taking control and making money. That's what I've learned from all the prods I get from them. 

when I was young, and the internet first introduced itself to me, I dreamt of communicating with friends and nice people around the world. Instead, I get prodded by Mark Fuckerberg twenty times a day.

everything on the internet was once put there by a person. if you see something on the internet, it's because someone put it there / made the active decision to place it there to be prodded. for me, this made it clear that the internet was a window into other people's lives around the world.

whether that's a good thing or not depends on who you're prodding and who's prodding you. the internet is this insane extrapolated manifestation of people's choices, multiplied by how much time and money that person has. 

we live in a system where the more money you have, the more likely it is that you're a massive cunt. this means that the internet is a manifestation of the biggest cunts of humankind. this means that the internet is bad.

## How to fix the internet

to fix the internet, you need to fix the people behind the internet. to do that, we need to stop all the cunts in the top 1% of wealth around the world. to do that, we need to stop financially rewarding cunty behaviour. to do that, we need to end populism. to do that we need to work together. to do that, we need to reach lots of people. to do that, we need to use the internet, despite it being bad
