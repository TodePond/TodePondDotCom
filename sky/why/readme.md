# Why do I do what I do and not something else

Why do I do the things I do and not something else? Why do I make videos? and post things online? Why do I play strudel? and the ukulele? Why do I write code? Why do I give talks? Why do I go to events? Why do I write blog posts? Why do I write essays? Why do I speak on podcasts? Why do I draw? Why do I walk? and sit? and watch the world walk past? Why do I spend my time doing the things I do and not something else?
