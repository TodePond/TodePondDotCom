# Definition of "live coding"

"Live coding is where changes to a running computer program are made by editing the underlying source code, with live feedback through the programming environment and/or via the program's output. " — [ICLC, 2015](https://iclc.toplap.org/2015/)

"Live coding is making changes to algorithms as they run, with the possibility for both live feedback and a live audience." — [ICLC, 2016](https://iclc.toplap.org/2016/)

"Live coding is a performance practice that revolves around the creation and modification of code and algorithms in real-time." — [ICLC, 2017](https://iclc.toplap.org/2017/en/index.html)

"Live coding refers to the creation and modification of algorithms with a creative purpose in real time often in the presence of a physical or virtual audience." — [ICLC, 2019](https://iclc.toplap.org/2019/ingles.html)

"Live coding is one of the most recent expressions of electronic music that manifests itself as a form of computer music in which various aesthetics intersect, ranging from experimental music (electroacoustic, noise or glitch) to various forms of club music (techno, dubstep or ambient among others); although it is a practice that encompasses other artistic expressions such as video or audiovisual production." — [ICLC, 2021](https://iclc.toplap.org/2021/)

"We believe the tension between what is live and what is not is a key element of live coding." — [ICLC, 2025](https://iclc.toplap.org/2025/)
