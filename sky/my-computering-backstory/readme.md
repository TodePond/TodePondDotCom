# My computering backstory

here's my computering backstory:

i was a teacher for most of my working life. i worked with young kids who had significant learning difficulties, often those who were excluded from other schools. it was a very intense job but i loved it deeply. i became a school governor and i led they provision's junior school department. the only reason I left was that schools are very bad places to be visibly queer (on the gender front). otherwise I'd still be there. it's pretty sad. this is the main inspiration behind "normalise sharing scrappy fiddles" - it's a political slogan about not needing to hide anything about yourself

i started creative coding when i started teaching. it was my emotional outlet at the end of the day. at some point, I decided to post something new from that creative work onto social media every day (and my streak is still going more or less) (i know you don't use social media). at some other point, I decided to start making videos about my work, to explain it better to non-coders like my partner Flora and our friends. I've continued making the videos all this time, and they have evolved into something far deeper and far more personal, and this is how I have built the small but committed audience that I have.

one of the creative coding projects i made (called Cellpond) became interesting to researchers in the HCI and/or "future of coding" scene. they were interested in it as an alternative way to program a computer. I submitted it to an academic conference, LIVE, which is all about live programming, but hilariously, utterly fails to acknowledge the existence of "live coding" as a form of live programming - (ask Alex about this).

cellpond got accepted and the talk i gave there went down really well and lots of people from that world started reaching out to me. i ended up doing this research residency thing.

fast forward... and I'm now a host of *the* future of coding podcast despite me becoming one of its more consistent critics. i kind of despise that world. i never really felt at home in it, but i continued. 

one of the things I made (called Arroost), was apparently a "live coding" tool. Joana Chicao and Ulysses saw me give a talk about it at the London future or coding meetup (recorded here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF2OF75ivZM) and they told me it was a live coding tool and they invited me along to the London live coding meetups and I was like "what the fuck is live coding" and the rest was history - https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/scrappy-fiddles/sharing/normalising/live/
