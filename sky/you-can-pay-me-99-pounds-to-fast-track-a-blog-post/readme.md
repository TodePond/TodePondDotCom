# You can pay me 99 pounds to fast track a blog post

I have a lot of planned blog posts in my backlog.

Some are things that I said I would eventually write about. Some are ideas I have [unfortunately](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogardenite/no/more/ideas/in/the/world/) had. And many blog posts are awaiting a sequel. Whatever the case, it takes a long time for me to get a blog post written and released.

Sadly, people occasionally message me to ask or tell me to hurry up! They want me to write the one that *they* are waiting for. 

<br>

As a capitalist (middle class artist), I recognised this as an opportunity:

And I shared a list of my backlog at the time.

Surprisingly, two people took up the offer! And that's how we got [Chaos to the canon](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/london/canon/chaos/no-escape/). It wasn't very good, to be honest. But it was written! (One person chose that one and one person said they wanted anything, so I was able to double it up).

## A brand new business opportunity awaits you! 

You, yes you, could fast track a blog post too. Just [pay me](/pay) 99 pounds and pick something from the list.
