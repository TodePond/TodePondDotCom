# Sometimes rage is the right response 

When I'm mistreated, I get angry. 

When my friends get mistreated, I get angry. 

When my friends get killed, I get really really really angry!!

If you don't get angry when these things happen, then I think there's something wrong with you. I think you're maybe numb or maybe you don't care, or maybe you don't think it's right to get "angry".

Honestly, I think that anger is sometimes the most expected and appropriate response to things. Anger can be a force for good. It can drive us to do things to protect each other and fight back. It can be cathartic! It can give us energy! It can bring us together in all of our shared anger! 

Anger! is part of art and culture and music and always will be (unless the pricks take control). From [Rage Against The Machine](https://youtu.be/AmPN8MPw2dk?si=rnJ1z2UVZVEgCqYm) to [Jade](https://www.nme.com/news/music/jade-interview-glastonbury-2025-new-music-championing-lgbtq-community-little-mix-raye-3874942), artists have always and will always express their anger in their art (unless the pricks take control).

so... yes, I agree with them both.
