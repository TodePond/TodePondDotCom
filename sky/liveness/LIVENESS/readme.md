# LIVENESS

What's important to me is being and feeling connected to other people in the world. Doing things "live" is one of many ways of achieving this. It's immediate and it makes you vulnerable and open. 

But I didn't and don't start with liveness. It's only a means to an end, so I think it's wrong to hone in on it. Instead, I think we should focus on what's important to us as people, separate from any practice or art. I want to be connected! I want to listen! I want to be understood!
